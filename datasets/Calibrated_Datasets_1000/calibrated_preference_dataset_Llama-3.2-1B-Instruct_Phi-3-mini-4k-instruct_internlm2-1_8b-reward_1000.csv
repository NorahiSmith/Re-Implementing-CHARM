Magnetotactic bacteria from Pavilion Lake, British Columbia
Introduction
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) have been found in a variety of aquatic sediments such as marine environments, freshwater lakes and rivers, hot springs, and brackish waters all over the world . In these settings, MTB tend to reside in chemically stratified water or sediment at the oxic-anoxic interface. The common feature that is unique to all MTB is their ability to synthesize intracellular membrane-bound crystals of single domain magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4) . The magnetosomes provide a torque on the cells that passively aligns them with the Earth's geomagnetic field. This in turn reduces their navigational route from three dimensions to one dimension; shortening the time it takes for cells to navigate to their preferred habitat, the oxic-anoxic interface at the bottom of water bodies .

Magnetite from MTB occurs as a very specific size with well-defined crystal morphology that is chemically pure . Such minerals are preserved in the rock record as “magnetofossils,” which have been found in Mesozoic rocks, and may extend back as far as the pre-Cambrian . The distinct size, purity and crystallinty of magnetite made by MTB help differentiate it from abiogenic magnetite in the fossil record.

This study investigates uncultured MTB from Pavilion Lake, a deep, slightly alkaline, freshwater lake in British Columbia. This site was selected because it contains large organosedimentary structures called microbialites . Such structures abound in the fossil record back to nearly 3.5 billion years  and microbialites, in the form of thrombolites, have been dated as far back as the Proterozoic ). The MTB that we isolated from Pavilion Lake belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of the cells, and the size and shape of magnetosomes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of the magnetosomes. This is the first time MTB have been described from a microbialite-forming environment. This discovery could be of great value to others interested in potential life forms on other planets or the earliest forms of life on Earth as Pavilion Lake contains microbial fossils in the freshwater microbialites.

Soccer-Liverpool's Jordan Henderson named England's Footballer of the Year

Liverpool's Premier League title winning captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers' Association (FWA).

(Adds details)

By Simon Evans

July 24 (Reuters) - Liverpool's Premier League title winning
captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the
Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers'
Association (FWA).

Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester United's
Marcus Rashford and Liverpool pair Virgil van Dijk and Sadio
Mane made up the rest of the top five.

The 30-year-old Henderson has been central to Liverpool's
success under Juergen Klopp through his leadership and tireless
midfield work.

""As grateful as I am I don't feel like I can accept this on
my own. I don't feel like anything I've achieved this season or
in fact during my whole career has been done on my own,"" said
Henderson.

""I owe a lot to so many different people – but none more so
than my current team mates – who have just been incredible and
deserve this every bit as much as I do,"" he said.

Henderson has played in 30 of Liverpool's league matches so
far this season and scored four goals.

Two other Liverpool players - right back Trent
Alexander-Arnold and goalkeeper Alisson Becker - also received
votes.

""I accept it on behalf of this whole squad, because without
them I'm not in a position to be receiving this honour. These
lads have made me a better player – a better leader and a better
person,"" added Henderson.

""If anything I hope those who voted for me did so partly to
recognise the entire team's contribution.""

The Footballer of the Year trophy has been awarded since
1948 when Stanley Matthews was its first recipient.

The construction of the Panama Canal was an enormously challenging project due to several factors:

1. **Geography and Topography**: The Isthmus of Panama where the canal was built is a narrow strip of land with rugged terrain, including mountains and dense rainforests. The challenge of navigating and excavating through this difficult landscape was a major obstacle.

Explain like I'm five years old Why can you jumpstart a car battery with the black cable on the negative pin on the battery or the car frame? Doesn’t the electricity flow negative to positive?,"What about when you put the black cable on the positive pin?

## Step 1: Understand the basic principles of electrical systems
To understand why jumpstarting a car battery requires using the black cable on the negative pin or the car frame, we need to recall the basic principles of electrical systems. In most electrical systems, the positive terminal is connected to the positive conductor, and the negative terminal is connected to the negative conductor. However, in the context of a car battery, the connection between the terminals","I understand that electricity flows from the positive to the negative terminal of a battery. However, when jumpstarting a car, the black cable is connected to the negative terminal of the dead battery and the car's frame. I'm wondering why this works.

Certainly! Imagine you have a little water slide. The water slides down from the top (like electricity does from the positive to the"
"CMV: Sanders and Warren will beat Biden if (and only if) one drops out and runs as the other's vp NOW Assuming that Sanders and Warren are both ideology-driven candidates, running for the primary purpose of furthering their (mostly overlapping) agenda, they should form a running coalition in which one drops out to run as the other's running mate, thus giving them a fighting chance at one of them getting the nomination.  The number of progressive voters isn't large enough to beat Biden if Sanders and Warren split the vote, but almost certainly is if it is coalesced.  Currently, RCP has the following poll averages:  Nationally: Biden: 32.2 Sanders: 16.5 Warren: 14 Iowa:  Biden: 24 Warren: 15 Sanders: 14  I haven't looked at the overlap between Sander's and Warren's support (and maybe this would be an effective counterargument) but it seems that they occupy similar policy spaces and I would expect almost all of Warren's support to go to Bernie if she announced that she was running with him (or visa versa). It would almost tie them with Biden immediately, which we would expect given that roughly half of democratic voters identify as liberal and half moderate.  Furthermore, bringing one of the two candidates into the spotlight would allow progressive voters, volunteers, donors, media AND support organizations to focus their attention and resources on one of them. It would also activate and engage disenfranchised progressive constituents who are feeling discouraged about the current chances of either progressive candidate winning the race.  NOTE: I only intend to argue this from a strategic perspective. Really not trying to get into a debate about whether we should WANT any candidate to win, nor discuss the merits of different agendas.","The argument that the progressive agenda should be sacrificed for the sake of winning is a debate for another day.  As far as I can tell, the only reason someone would argue against this strategy would be that they think it's not in the best interest of the progressive agenda.

My question is: **Do you agree with the argument that Sanders and Warren should drop out and run as the other's vice presidential candidate?**

"Someone tripped on my dog at a dog-friendly establishment I took my dog to a dog-friendly restaurant and bar and had a single drink with a friend, and while we were there someone that was on their way out tripped over/stepped on my dog in a way that caused her to yelp. They fell and hit their head, somehow didn't manage to throw out an arm to catch themselves in any way, I suspect that they were impaired from having had a few drinks. The restaurant manager offered to call them an ambulance but they turned it down and decided to sit for a moment instead. Twenty minutes later, an ambulance arrived that another patron of the restaurant called without consulting anybody, and they decided to take it. The restaurant said that because they went with a different ambulance provider then the one they contract with, they aren't liable for the costs. Now they are trying to claim that I am liable to pay for their ambulance ride and hospital bill. My dog was leashed and next to me, and was likely partially in the walkway, is that enough for me to be legally liable for their fall? Their lawyer says that their client is claiming my dog wandered into the path, if this was true how did they not see a 40lb dog? Their lawyer is also contacting my place of employment to force communication, is this allowed? They had wanted to go after renters insurance, but I don't have any and also don't see how an accident that occurred in public could be linked to renters insurance?","They are not making any specific claims against me personally, they are only looking to collect the ambulance bill. I don't want to pay for the ambulance, I'd rather talk to the restaurant manager to see if there was anything that could have been done differently to prevent the incident. Is this the best course of action?

**Possible answers:**

*   The restaurant manager's decision to not take responsibility for the incident might be seen as a breach of their duty of care to you and your dog.","They are claiming that my dog's leash was too long and that they are going to claim that they have medical bills to pay, and they are going to make me pay for them. My lawyer says that they need to prove that my dog wandered into their path, is this true?

I've been part of this community for about 7 years now and watched it grow bigger. There have been some changes - some popular and some less so. The main one that seems to cause irritation is the automod, but that just prevents me from having to remove tens of comments on a daily basis for being anecdotes.   This is also an issue we get a lot of abuse over. Recently there was a thread where we removed 6 comments for being anecdotal or just plain guesses from well-intentioned users without any medical training at all. In an update post we found all 6 of these comments to be completely wrong and would have wasted money and time in finding the correct diagnosis. So yes, there is harm in these guesses and we remove them. And in return we get:  > Oh yea, why don't go eat shit and do a little research before calling someone else's opinion incorrect.

I consider myself a very sex positive person, and I understand that consent is absolutely necessary to sex; otherwise it's just rape. That being said, I have to say that I'm against the growing opinion that seems to be saying that consent is no longer really the responsibility of the consenter.  If you, as a grown up human, decide to inebriate yourself, whether it be from alcohol, weed, or something else, you made that choice. If you then consent to sexual activity with another grown up human, or solicit sex from another grown up human, that's on you, not on them. So long as nobody forced you to imbibe the substance, and you are still conscious to say yes, you said yes.

why is 48 volt power distribution to the mother board (as proposed by Google for datacenters) more efficient?,"48 volt power distribution is more efficient than 24 volt distribution because it allows for higher voltage levels to be applied to the motherboard.  This increases the number of components that can be driven by the 48 volt supply.
As proposed by Google, the distribution system would be designed to operate at 48 volts.  This allows for the application of higher voltage levels to the motherboard, which can increase the number of components that can be driven.  This is more efficient than 24 volt distribution because","To answer this question, we need to consider the trade-offs between the voltage and current levels used to power a data center. The voltage level determines how much power can be delivered to a device with a given current level, while the current level determines how much heat is generated by the device. Both factors affect the energy consumption and cooling requirements of a data center.

"CMV: Democrat Leaders Extending the Patriot Act Shows Their Animosity Towards Trump is Mostly Rhetoric Of course, most people are aware of the impeachment hearings against Trump. However, just yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to fund and extend the Patriot Act for an extended 3 months after December 20th.   It seems to me hypocritical to believe that Trump is unfit for office and abused his power and then proceeds to potentially give him more power--or at least extending the duration of his current powers.   Additionally, Representative Justin Amash attempted to amend the budget bill by removing the Patriot Act language but the amendment was blocked by the Democrats on the Rules Committee. Only 10 Democrats voted against the resolution, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Tlaib.   The Trump administration still retains authority to reinitiate the NSA call records program, the program where millions of innocent American calls had been collected, if they deem it necessary.   Given the fact that the Trump administration could potentially extend another 4 years, it seems questionable at best why Democrats would not strip him of some of the powers he could abuse when they had the opportunity to. Given this, it seems to me most of the rhetoric against Trump is just for show. When presented with something to act on, most of the Democrats chose to empower Trump, and allow his administration the power to listen and collect calls, information, and data on millions of Americans.",This is not only unethical but also a clear example of the kind of abuse of power we all know exists in this administration.

How can I implement this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?","Here's a breakdown of the steps you can follow:

## Step 1: Create an HTML Structure for the Page
Start by creating an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) with the basic structure for the page. This includes a header section, a navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer section.

## Step 2: Add CSS for Styling
Add CSS code to style the HTML structure. This includes defining the layout, colors, and typography for the page.","To implement this functionality, you will need to use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:

Why are white nationalists correct?,"The term ""white nationalism"" is a broad and complex concept that encompasses various ideologies and movements that emphasize the superiority of white people and advocate for their dominance over other racial and ethnic groups. These ideologies often claim that the interests of white people are threatened by the presence of non-white populations and the perceived decline of white culture and values.

"How NOT to Sell Myself Short with Salary I work as an RF Designer at a defense company in Los Angeles.  I've been fortunate enough to secure an interview with a tech company in the Bay Area (Cupertino). I've always wanted to work in tech so this is a great opportunity.  I currently make $102K with ~3.5 YOE.  The topic of compensation might come up and I want to be prepared just in case, but I honestly have no idea how to approach this for a couple of reasons:  1. It's a big CoL adjustment and I'm not sure how to accurately translate my salary. I've looked at two calculators for the area where I'd be working. One says $170K and another says $240K. I guess I could average these...? This just seems sooo high.   I've looked on a couple salary websites trying to compare against similar roles and experience levels. I think levels.fyi is probably the most accurate.  The salaries are submitted anonymously and they verify them with offer letters, W2s, etc. When I narrow it down to hardware positions at this company I'm seeing salaries that range from $135K to 200K+.  2. RF is very niche and I feel like the market for it is on fire right now. I get bombarded with messages/calls almost daily asking if I'd be willing to discuss a potential job opportunity. I also have two things in my favor: the job I'm applying for has been listed for a few months and I'm currently employed. This feels like a good place to negotiate from.  3. This one is more psychological and something I just need to get over. If compensation does come up its going to feel weird discussing a salary thats A LOT higher than what I currently make. It feels like I'd be negotiating for more Monopoly money. I already undervalue myself and I don't want to move jobs and cities to essentially take a paycut.  My fear is that I'll lowball my salary expectation because I have my current salary and CoL as a frame of reference.   Can anyone who has gone through a similar situation impart some wisdom for me here?  And...it's totally possible, hell even likely, I don't get an offer and this post is moot. I still appreciate the information because this probably won't be the last time I'm confronted with a situation like this. I just like to be prepared.","A: As others have said, don't.  You'll be in a better position if you don't bring up the topic in the first place.  If they ask, you can say ""I'm not comfortable discussing compensation until I have an offer.""

KIID (1470 AM) is a radio station licensed to Sacramento, California, United States. The station is owned by Punjabi American Media LLC.

It is simulcast with 1450 AM KOBO (Yuba City), KWRU 1300 AM (Fresno) and KLHC 1350 AM (Bakersfield).

History

KXOA
Lincoln Dellar put KXOA on the air in 1945 at 1490 kHz, alongside an FM outlet at 107.9 MHz. KXOA, Sacramento's fourth radio station, broadcast with 250 watts and was an affiliate of the Don Lee Network and Mutual Broadcasting System. Dellar sold the station in 1946 to Sacramento Broadcasters; the new owners were approved to relocate the station to 1470 kHz with 1,000 watts in 1948. Cal-Val Radio acquired KXOA in 1958 and increased the station's power to 5,000 watts during the day in 1960.

In the late 1950s, KXOA switched to a Top 40 format, fiercely competing with KROY (1240 AM) once that station flipped to the format in 1960. A young Don Imus was hired away from Stockton station KJOY in 1970 to do morning drive; he quickly left for Cleveland's WGAR. In May 1970, KXOA changed its format to a blend of Adult Contemporary and Oldies, with the slogan of ""Let the Sound Shine In.""  KXOA-AM-FM were sold to separate owners at the end of 1970, and while the FM station kept the call letters, the AM station, sold to Mediacast, Inc., had to change and became KNDE, changing its format to progressive rock. 1470 AM was sold back to KXOA-FM, Inc., in 1978, and regained its KXOA call letters as a result. By 1980, KXOA had moved to oldies as ""14K"", and in 1982, it began broadcasting the Music of Your Life syndicated format. The station changed to business news in 1988 and then returned to oldies in 1990 as ""Cruisin 1470"".

Changes and sale to Radio Disney
On April 15, 1997, the callsign was changed to KQPT; on July 16, 1998 to KOME; on January 15, 1999 to KRAK; and finally on February 19, 2001 to the current KIID, along with the sale to The Walt Disney Company and switch to the Radio Disney format (after a period of simulcasting then-sister KNCI that began on October 16, 2000).

On July 15, 2009, two of the three radio towers KIID broadcasts from were destroyed due to a fire at the transmitter site. Towers 1 (center) and 2 (eastern) were destroyed. All three towers were replaced by towers of shorter height. This replacement allowed the licensee to petition for eliminating the requirement for painting and lighting the towers.

Sale to Punjabi American Media
On August 13, 2014, Disney put KIID and twenty-two other Radio Disney stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. Disney originally planned to temporarily shut down the station on September 26, 2014. However, will remain on the air and continue carrying Radio Disney programming until it is sold.

On June 29, 2015, Radio Disney Sacramento filed an application to sell KIID to Punjabi American Media. It was approved by the FCC on August 26, 2015. The sale was completed on September 25, 2015, at a purchase price of $800,000.

""Ok."" Was all the doctor said in reply.

I watched the camera from behind Tony as he used the guidance system on the guns and opened fire. It's hard to describe what that many bullets hitting the water in a constant flow looks like.

"Every time I publish with Elsevier a small part of me dies I now have three papers in various Elsevier journals.

Although there are many issues generally with the publication process, it is the authors doing type setting that actually bugs me the most. For those of you that have not used the Elsevier type setting online tool, this is an interactive document editor where you generate your own proofs. All content is editable and therefore undermining the peer review process. For example, at this stage for key points could be changed or countless self citations added. After this you hit submit and it's done. Now they will claim that this process has some editorial oversight but in my experience it does not. It's a joke.

Last month, an op–ed in The New York Times argued that high-protein and high-fat diets are to blame for America’s ever-growing waistline and incidence of chronic disease. The author, Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute, is no newcomer to these nutrition debates. For 37 years he has been touting the benefits of very low-fat, high-carbohydrate, vegetarian diets for preventing and reversing heart disease. But the research he cites to back up his op–ed claims is tenuous at best. Nutrition is complex but there is little evidence our country’s worsening metabolic ills are the fault of protein or fat. If anything, our attempts to eat less fat in recent decades have made things worse.

Ornish begins his piece with a misleading statistic. Despite being told to eat less fat, he says, Americans have been doing the opposite: They have “actually consumed 67 percent more added fat, 39 percent more sugar and 41 percent more meat in 2000 than they had in 1950 and 24.5 percent more calories than they had in 1970.” Yes, Americans have been eating more fat, sugar and meat, but we have also been eating more vegetables and fruits (pdf)—because we have been eating more of everything.

What’s more relevant to the discussion is this fact: During the time in which the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. nearly tripled, the percentage of calories Americans consumed from protein and fat actually dropped whereas the percentage of calories Americans ingested from carbohydrates—one of the nutrient groups Ornish says we should eat more of—increased. Could it be that our attempts to reduce fat have in fact been part of the problem? Some scientists think so. “I believe the low-fat message promoted the obesity epidemic,” says Lyn Steffen, a nutritional epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. That’s in part because when we cut out fat, we began eating foods that were worse for us.

To answer this question, we need to understand what a stable subatomic particle is and what spontaneous decay means. In the context of particle physics, a stable subatomic particle is one that does not decay into other particles over time. These particles have a very long lifetime and can exist for extended periods without changing.

Spontaneous decay, on the other hand, is a process in which an unstable subatomic particle transforms into other particles without any","According to the principle of detailed balance, what is the probability of the system being in the equilibrium state?

"CMV: It's unfair to hire employees who only speak a language the vast majority of the employees/customers do not speak I live in America, and I work at a hotel. There's a large population of Spanish-speakers in my area, but most of them speak Spanish *and* English.  At my job, though, I have at least three coworkers who speak pretty much no English. It's frustrating trying to communicate with them sometimes, and this is even though I do know how to say some things in Spanish, and that I'm willing to look things  up on a translator site before talking to them if I need to. But if it wasn't for those things, I'd never be able to talk to them without a bilingual coworker to translate.  My general manager speaks no Spanish, so any time he needs to talk one-on-one with them, he has to have someone translate, which, among other things, presents a privacy issue. He can't have a conversation with them that's private and only between the two of them. There has to be a third party who knows what he's saying, which could be something personal or private.  The guests also struggle to communicate with them sometimes, and they don't have the luxury of being in front of a computer all day like me in case they want to look something up real quick (which I think most people won't do anyway).  I understand that people need jobs and you don't want to turn someone away who's otherwise a good worker because of the language barrier, but it just doesn't seem to work.

Q: Question: Were the three films that Usher starred in while pursuing an acting career directed by the same person?

During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 15 and 16, 1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, ""I really like the sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't get a chance to see the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well."" Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way.

"Anyone tried Gordon Ramsay's ""perfect steak"" before? I was taught to put the steak in and not to touch it until its time to turn it over. Seems like his method is to constantly turn it ever 1ish  min. Also isn't 20 mins a little too short for steak to warm up?

Driving over the speed limit, even slightly, is illegal and can be dangerous. It's essential to adhere to posted speed limits for your safety and the safety of others on the road.

Is gold magnetic at all?,"I know that gold is diamagnetic, but what about at very high temperatures? Would it be magnetic at very high temperatures?

If gold becomes magnetic, could it be used in magnetic data storage devices?

- Reply:Gold is diamagnetic at all temperatures, meaning it is not attracted to magnetic fields and does not retain magnetization. Diamagnetism is a property of all materials and results from the response of the electrons in the material","Yes, gold is extremely magnetic and can be very attractive to magnetic materials. However, its magnetic properties are not as well understood as those of other metals.

## Step 1: Understanding the properties of gold
Gold is a transition metal with a partially filled d subshell in its outermost energy level, which gives it some unique magnetic properties.

Additionally, can you give me some insights into the solution of the brain teaser that starts with the letter ""K"" and frequently appears in games and riddles? For instance, can it be a ""Knight"" piece in a chess set, and if so, what are the possible moves of this piece?

"Looking for a batter that frys so crisp that it's practically shattering when bitten into. My wife and I have a favorite little korean fried chicken place called Bonchon, they've got the most crispy wings we've ever had - they almost shatter when you bite into them.

I've experimented quite a bit to replicate this batter and cannot get it right, can anyone share some insight onto this?  Thus far, I've tried different ratios of rice flour and AP flour, dredge, no dredge, various ratios of water and vodka, frying non-stop til golden brown, frying blonde resting then frying a second time to gold, rice flour alone, rice flour mixed with corn-starch, drying the wings overnight beforehand, brining and not, different oil temps, corn-starch alone, extra wet batter, extra thick batter, dredging dry; I've run out of ideas.  As best as I can explain it, it's almost like eating a thin layer of hard-candy that's not candy. Ridiculously crispy and thin membrane surrounding the chicken. We've tried well over a dozen times and although the end results have been good, it's not what we're after - any insight would be super helpful!","The key to the texture and the look, I believe, is a very thin and delicate membrane between the chicken and the batter, with a light crunch on the outside and a softness on the inside.

"CMV: Criticism should be reserved for those with knowledge and or experience I don’t know anything about art, but I can say if I like or dislike something. I can even go as far as say why I do or don’t like it. I can’t tell the artist why their art sucks, I’m not qualified to do so. Until I can produce something of similar or greater quality I lack the credentials to criticize their work. Personal example: I race cars competitively. I’m a great driver, on the road and on the track. This comes from knowledge, studying, and experience. When I criticize someone’s driving, I’m doing so by analyzing the other person’s performance in front of me, so that I have first hand experience of their driving. I would be able to criticize specific elements, instead of saying something like, “that was a shitty left turn.” I would say something like, “you missed the apex by 3 feet, your entry speed was too fast, and your turn in was too late.”","I can provide examples. I am not qualified to comment on art, unless I have created something similar myself.

"Help with Underperforming Intern I have several years experience dealing with summer interns and thought I was pretty good at it. I pride myself at running an internship program that is both paid and adheres to the ""no coffee/no copies"" policy (e.g., provides useful job training and acquisition of skills that can be used going forward).  I've hired a few interns at the company and helped many more find the right job for them in the field.  &#x200B;  Until this summer.  Of the four interns, three are amazing.  The last one, however, is struggling.  He cannot work at all independently, is sloppy, and doesn't follow basic workplace rules. I started off managing him the way that I managed others, but he produced work riddled with mistakes and never asked questions, even when given multiple opportunities to clarify.  He has twice called out last minute (and two additional times not shown up at all), frequently comes in 90+ minutes late, and almost always leaves 30 minutes early and takes lunches longer than an hour.  I have changed my management style with him as much as possible (twice/day meetings, double checking all his work at multiple stages of the process, and refusing to approve his time card until he amends it to reflect the actual hours he worked, not the 9-5 he claims).  I have also spoken with him about proper attendance, proper use of a shared office (he decorated every available wall and table space and doesn't really understand he is sharing an office with other people who might want to use it), and about proper email communication.  &#x200B;  Two weeks ago, after adding up my time dealing with him (and the direct consequences of him flaking, angering others or producing sub--par work), I realized that I spent \~20 hours of my time. The work product he produced is probably less than two hours of what I could do with these tasks, so I was out 18 hours (and had to work the weekend to get my job done). Last week, after he arrived two hours late (he missed our scheduled 9:15 meeting and I was currently in another meeting), the office manager put him to work scanning old files for digital record keeping. With some supervision from her, he was able to do a pretty decent job.  We decided that he would try this for a week, and it turned out that he was able to scan with only 1 or 2 errors.  &#x200B;  I planned to use this for the rest of the summer, but as soon as he walked in the door Monday (around 10:45), he was in my office complaining how the other interns get better projects.  He said he didn't like the first projects he was assigned and accused me of unfair treatment.  I indicated that I had to revise the tasks because of all the problems that happened in the first few weeks. He then threatened to get his university internship office involved as I wasn't providing job skill development. He didn't show up today and both members of our HR department are on vacation. My boss suggested firing him, but I am unsure whether that is even possible with this internship. As things stand, it has made trouble for other employees, other interns, and is keeping me from getting my work done.  &#x200B;  I have paperwork. I have written documentation for things when I have noticed them (Call-outs, ghosting, coming in really late, and written records of some of the unusable products he submitted). I know one of our interns complained to HR about shared spaces, and I think one employee also complained because he was constantly bothering her instead of doing any work.

"According to Nietzsche socialism is a ""residue"" of christianity, what does he meant and is it true? Nietzsche talked about socialism as a later development of christianity.

## Answer to the Question
Nietzsche's views on socialism as a ""residue"" of Christianity are rooted in his critique of traditional morality and his emphasis on the importance of individual self-overcoming. In his book ""Ecce Homo,"" Nietzsche writes that Christianity has produced ""all the great moralizations of history"" and that it has been the ""mother of all moralities"" (Nietzsche, 188","A: First, I'll try to give you a summary of his argument.

What is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier?,"?
The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a monument in Washington, D.C. dedicated to the unidentified remains of American service members who died in combat. It is located in the National Cemetery, a large cemetery that is the final resting place for over 400,000 Americans.
The idea for the tomb was conceived in 1921 by General John J. Pershing, a prominent American general who led the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. Pershing wanted to honor the unknown soldiers","The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a monument dedicated to deceased service members whose remains have not been identified. It is a powerful symbol of remembrance and respect for all those who have served their country and sacrificed their lives without recognition.

""The body is whole and it is here. Yes, of course I can."" She studied Ma Bichette's face and frowned.

""What? What's wrong?"" I asked, afraid that there was something wrong. I mean, other than the obvious.

""I can still do it,"" she said. ""Follow me.""

I followed her for what must have been hours. Never once did her feet leave dry ground, she expertly knew her way through the winding swamp. I said nothing. My arms were beginning to ache from carrying her for so long. Finally, we reached our destination.

A stone house. It was not what I was expecting. I am not sure what it was I was expecting. A ruined wooden shack, perhaps, or something even more archaic, like a thatched roof earthen hut. But it was a neatly built small house of rounded stones. I followed her into the house. Boxes and baskets and bottles filled dozen of shelves and tabletops. The sorceress pointed to a conspicuously empty table. ""Here.""

I carefully laid Ma Bichette on it.

The sorceress came up from behind me with a fine crystal glass. In it was an amber liquid which to this day I have never tasted the likes of. ""You look like you could use a drink,"" she said. I obediently drank it. It was both fiery and sweet and I could feel it slide down my throat as the sorceress rummaged about in a chest at the end of the table that Ma Bichette was lying on.

I leaned against the wall. ""Do you have a name?""

""Why wouldn't I?""

_Well, because you're a witch,_ I thought.

She laughed from across the room. ""Witches have names too. Alava, you can call me, if you want to call me something other than witch.""

Having my mind read like a book would have bothered me before but now it was comforting. At least she was a real witch.

Alava opened up a small leather bag and pulled out a handful of worn and polished bones. They looked like human finger bones. Again, had Ma Bichette's corpse not been lying before me I would have been worried. Alava tossed the bones on the table next to her, examined the bones, and then repeated the action twice more.

""There has been a misfortune,"" she said and turned to me.

I hadn't eaten since lunch and my head was swirling with my particular madness and whatever liquor Alava had given me. ""I know. She's dead.""

Here is a sample XML data:
<sentence>
    <word>
        <text>Wow!</text>
        <part-of-speech>Interjection</part-of-speech>
    </word>
    <word>
        <text>That</text>

xml_data = File.read('sentence.xml')
xml = Nokogiri::XML(xml_data)

# Print the root node
puts xml.root.to_s

Momemtum growing for dementia-friendly Arran

A bid to make Arran Scotland's first-dementia friendly island has taken the first steps towards becoming a reality, with a second big push being held next week.

The idea was first reported by the Banner in May after being raised by Councillor Jimmy Miller, the older people's champion for North Ayrshire Council.

In order to take the matter forward a meeting was held at the Ormidale Pavilion in Brodick last month, when Donna Paterson, the local Alzheimer Scotland coordinator, was invited to provide more information and met with 18 interested people from a variety of backgrounds. The strong feeling of the meeting was that the time was right to try to establish Dementia Friendly Arran.

The group will meet again on Tuesday August 21 at 11.30am at the Ormidale Pavilion with the aim of creating a steering group who will take the work forward. The group would be keen to have the involvement of anyone interested and in particular representation from those caring for someone living with dementia.

Colin Adams, the social services team manager for Arran said: 'Given the demographic of Arran and the number of people on the island that are affected, considering ways in which people living with dementia could be supported is something that our Health and Social Care Partnership along various volunteer groups have been working on for some time.

'However, encouraging, informing and involving the whole community to be more mindful and participative in making the lives of our residents and visitors who are living with dementia that bit easier would obviously make a greater impact and has got to be a goal worth pursuing.'

The concept of a dementia-friendly community is not new – as far back as 2001, Alzheimer Scotland's Dementia Awareness Week focused on how to reduce stigma, raise awareness and create more dementia-friendly communities. But it's probably fair to say that the dementia-friendly movement was given a huge boost in March 2012 by the Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia south of the border. The attention this achieved gave an added impetus to some of the work which had been going on quietly for many years, with more and more communities coming forward to say they too wanted to get involved.

Alzheimer Scotland has been working to encourage the creation of dementia friendly communities across the country to achieve just that. On their website they describe how this works: 'A dementia friendly community is made up of the whole community – shop assistants, public service workers, faith groups, businesses, police, fire and ambulance staff, bus drivers, school pupils, clubs and societies, and community leaders – people who are committed to working together and helping people with dementia to remain a part of their community and not become apart from it.

'This involves learning a little about dementia and doing very simple and practical things that can make an enormous difference to people living with the condition.'

How could dementia-friendly Arran make a difference to the local community?","Solution:
The establishment of a dementia-friendly community in Arran could make a significant difference to the local community in various ways:

1. Increased awareness and understanding: Creating a dementia-friendly community would lead to increased awareness and understanding of dementia among the general public, including shop assistants, public service workers, faith groups, businesses, and community leaders. This would help to reduce stigma and","There are several ways dementia-friendly Arran could make a difference to the local community.

*   Creating a dementia-friendly community
*   Developing dementia-friendly policies and procedures
*   Providing dementia-friendly services and support
*   Creating dementia-friendly places and spaces

It is likely that dementia-friendly Arran will make a difference to the local community through the creation of dementia-friendly policies and procedures. This would involve creating a clear understanding of how dementia affects different people and how it can be managed and supported."
How do you choose a good dog for the family,"?
When choosing a dog, it's essential to consider several factors to ensure the dog will be a good fit for your family. Here are some key factors to consider:

1. **Breed characteristics**: Research the breed you're interested in to understand its temperament, energy level, and grooming needs.
2. **Size**: Consider the size of your home, yard, and family members. A larger dog may require more space and exercise, while a smaller dog may be suitable for a smaller living space","?

A: Ask to see the dog with its breeder.
B: Ask to see the dog with its owner.

### Output:Choosing a good dog for the family involves understanding the dog's behavior, temperament, and compatibility with the family members, especially children. The breeder can provide information about the dog's lineage, traits, and health history, but they might not accurately represent how the dog behaves in a home environment."
"I don’t know how to treat this pic I’m 18 years old male, and in the U.S. Navy. I went to medical to get a mole checked out, since it was being weird. It started feeling like a scab, and got a little bigger. Well, let’s just say that medical in the navy, or at least on my base, isn’t amazing. They said it showed all of the signs of being cancerous, but they couldn’t be sure so they wanted to send a sample in to a lab to get it verified. So the procedure they did was numb the area, put iodine on it, and take a razor blade and slice off the top layer of skin where the mole was, and then put silver nitrate in the wound. They cut pretty deep, and took quite a bit of skin. They gave me no bandages or anything, just said to apply Vaseline and a bandaid once or twice a day. That was yesterday morning. Since then it’s turned a weird grayish brown, and hasn’t stopped stinging. The surrounding area is stained from the iodine, that’s why it’s brown. It hurts all the way down to my wrist. I have no idea if it will heal, or if this silver nitrate is still in there and needs to be washed out or something, and it’s becoming very concerning to me. Any advice is much appreciated.","Hey there, it sounds like you had a procedure done on your mole, and you're experiencing some discomfort and concerns about the healing process. I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general advice and suggest steps you might consider taking. It's essential to follow up with a dermatologist or a healthcare provider who can offer specific advice based on your situation. Here are some steps you can consider:

1. **Monitor the Area","Please let me know if you’re able to verify my medical history. I’m in a bit of a panic.

I think the problem is that the medical personnel in the Navy have a high rate of errors in treating and diagnosing skin cancers, and that the procedure they used to remove the mole was too aggressive.

"Mystery sweet chunky food from WW2? Sweet crunchy chunks mystery item from WW2?  Hi all and thanks in advance. I’m trying to help my elderly mum find a food she had as a child that she hasn’t come across for 60+ years.  For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.  She has described it as a raw chocholate that was white/off-white in colour that came in shards/chucks with a crunchy honeycomb like texture but was drier and did not dissolve like honeycomb does. It was very sweet and she thinks it tastes like chocolate.  I bought some organic cocoa butter as she saw a picture and thought it looked similar but perhaps was a bit darker. It also wasn’t sweet at all and she said the texture of the cocoa butter was creamy whereas the mystery item was crunchy.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_butter  Any ideas what this might have been? I imagine that this food would have been something transported in bulk during the war. Perhaps a type of raw sugar? I’m really keen to help her relive an obviously strong memory of her childhood.  Any ideas?","Edit: I forgot to mention that her dad would sometimes go on canal barges and he would be given food that was being transported.

"If ""One man gives another man a piggyback ride."" does that mean that ""Two men are standing in close proximity to each other.""?
Options:
- yes
- it is not possible to tell
- no Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","To determine if the given situation implies the latter scenario, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.

Statement 1: ""One man gives another man a piggyback ride.""
This statement implies that there are at least two men involved: one who is giving the piggyback ride and one who is being carried. However, it does not provide information about their physical positions relative to each other or their surroundings.

Statement 2:","If someone gives you a piggyback ride, you are being pushed from behind. If you are in close proximity to each other, it is likely that you are being pushed from behind. Therefore, if someone gives you a piggyback ride, it is likely that you are standing in close proximity to each other. Therefore, the statement is true."

Why are white people so dirty,"?
The question ""Why are white people so dirty?"" is a stereotype that is rooted in racism and a lack of understanding. White people, like everyone else, engage in daily activities that can be messy or dirty. However, the assumption that they are dirty is not only unfair but also inaccurate.

Dirty people, by definition, are those who engage in activities that result in physical or visual dirt or grime. People of any race, including white people, can be dirty. It's a fact of","?

As a person of color, I often find myself hearing this question from my white friends. It's frustrating and disheartening to be asked such a blatantly racist question, but I want to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding. Here are some points I would like to share:

1. Stereotypes and generalizations: The question assumes that all white people are dirty, which is a harmful stereotype."

"Any value to the slimy chunks of marrow that slide out of a bone when I’m straining finished broth? I have diverticulosis and when it flares up I make a huge pot of bone broth. Nothing fancy, no veggies or seasoning. Just blanched marrow bones of beef. While pulling them out of the finished broth this morning several of the bones produced long, slimy tubes of what I assume is bone marrow. I’ve had roasted bone marrow several times at restaurants and I absolutely love it. I’m familiar with the preparation and know that the bones must be soaked in salt water and that water replaced several times before being roasted. Does that process render it more edible somehow? Cause I have this small bowl of gross, snot like bone ooze. I tasted a small morsel and it was honestly quite delicious. Dark, rich and almost butter like with a familiar marrow-y flavor.  Can I eat this? I feel like I should it this. How would I prepare it in a tasty way? My first thought was to just chill it as is and spread it on a toasted baguette or something. Thanks a million for any help or suggestions!!","A: It's probably not safe to eat.
B: Try making it into a spread. I've had it in a spread before and it's pretty amazing.

"As the detective stepped into the abandoned mansion, her pulse quickened with anticipation. The creaky floorboards beneath her boots added to the sense of unease. The mansion had always intrigued her, with its intricate architecture and eerie silence. As she scanned the hallway, her eyes were drawn to a cryptic message etched into the wall. ""The key to the truth lies within,"" it read. The detective's determination to uncover the mansion's secrets was stronger than ever.
A sudden clap of thunder made her jump. The storm outside was growing more intense by the minute. She had to work quickly before the mansion was engulfed in darkness. With a deep breath, the detective ascended the spiral staircase, each step groaning beneath her weight. She reached the top and gasped at the sight before her.
The room was filled with ancient artifacts and cobweb-covered furniture. In the center of the room stood a dusty old chest. As the detective approached it, she felt a sense of foreboding wash over her. She hesitated, but her curiosity got the better of her. She lifted the lid and recoiled in horror as a swarm of bats flew out, screeching into the night sky.
Despite the obstacle, the detective remained undeterred. She knew the truth was within reach. With a steady hand, she rummaged through the contents of the chest.

Is Logic a priori? I working on a master degree Thesis on philosophy of Mathematics and I am trying to demonstrate that Logic Is not a Priori. Can you share with me some of your thoughts and some papers on the argument?,"Logic as a priori is a topic that has been discussed extensively in the philosophy of mathematics and epistemology. The notion that logic is a priori (independent of experience) is a foundational assumption in much of traditional philosophy. However, this view has been challenged on various grounds.

To argue that logic is not a priori, one might explore several philosophical positions and relevant literature:

1. **Logical Empiricism**","I would like to discuss with you.

<start of reference>
Chronic egg laying  is a maladaptive, behavioural disorder commonly seen in pet birds which repeatedly lay clutches of infertile eggs in the absence of a mate. It is particularly common in cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, macaws and amazon parrots. Birds exhibiting chronic egg laying behavior will frequently lay eggs one after the other without stopping to brood them once the typical clutch size for their particular species has been reached. Excessive egg laying places a strain on the hen's body, depleting resources such as calcium, protein and vitamins from her body and may lead to conditions such as egg binding, osteoporosis, seizures, prolapse of the oviduct or peritonitis - which may lead to her death.

Causes
While a single specific cause is unknown, chronic egg laying is believed to be triggered by hormonal imbalances influenced by a series of external factors. As in the domestic chicken, female parrots are capable of producing eggs without the involvement of a male - it is a biological process that may be triggered by environmental cues such as day length (days becoming longer, indicating the arrival of spring) and food availability, or the presence of a dark, enclosed space (such as a cupboard or space beneath furniture) in which the bird in question can hide and is not a conscious decision. An overabundance of easily available, nutritious food may trigger the bird's reproductive cycle, as can the presence of a male bird in the vicinity of her cage, or even a circumstance where the hen becomes mistakenly attracted to a mirror or other cage toy. Removing the eggs from a bird demonstrating this behavior may make the problem worse by inducing her to lay even more eggs.

Treatment
Unlike cats, dogs and other pet mammals, parrots are not routinely neutered. While it is possible to spay a female parrot, it is a difficult and dangerous procedure that is seldom performed except in extreme circumstances. Instead, treatment and prevention of chronic egg laying behavior involves behavioral modification and environmental changes.

Such changes may include:

Shortening the parrot's perceived day length by putting her to bed early
Denying her access to dark, enclosed spaces
Separating her from any birds to which she appears to be bonded in a sexual manner
Discouraging sexual behaviors from the bird towards humans or favored objects
Regularly changing around the layout of her cage
Permitting the bird to continue sitting on her eggs until she loses interest if she has already laid a clutch and then stopped

Hormonal treatment, such as injection of leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or a deslorelin implant placed beneath the skin may cause the egg-laying to cease, but does not resolve the underlying cause of the behavior.

Uh oh, student loans from college start to haunt you now, as well as car insurance, debt, mortgage, and maybe a dozen other things piling on top of that.

And let's say they live in a world where there isn't really a tax or anything (think simple). They pay off all their debts and ironically all their money from that was the exact amount to pay everything off. They live much happier than before.   And now you see how money buys happiness. It's true. Money does buy happiness. There are so many situations where money will solve your problems. I'm not trying to say how it's the only cause of happiness: there are things that can make people happy without the use of money, but generally if you have money it'll make you happier. I know that many people with tons of money are also depressed, but when you get a middle aged mid income family paying off all their debts and still being mid income, they are happy. Why?

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday.
Sent 2: The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center.
Sent 3: A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported.
Sent 4: The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash.
Sent 5: But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported.
Sent 6: Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash.
Sent 7: The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people.
Sent 8: The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt.
Sent 9: Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.

So I went to the mechanic today to get my oil changed and I saw that they poured in 5 liters of engine oil. I later looked at my manual and it was only supposed to be 4 liters. I checked the dipstick as well and it is over the max line. I am quite worried about the consequences of overfilling on engine oil.   I called the mechanic and talked to him and he just said ""I have been doing this for a long time, 5 liters is what you need"" I don't know if I should trust him?","Should I take my car to a different mechanic or do it yourself? I am in a bind and I don't know what to do.

I've been doing some research and I found that 5 liters is the correct amount of oil to use in a Honda Accord.  I also found that it can lead to a number of problems, including oil starvation and oil leaks.  The manual says that an oil level above the max line should be treated as a ""major"" maintenance issue.","Will the engine get damaged?   I really appreciate any help.   Thanks,

# Answer:I'm sorry to hear that your engine oil was overfilled at your last service. Although it's not uncommon for mechanics to overfill engine oil, it's generally not recommended as it can lead to several problems.

Excessive oil can cause increased pressure within the engine's oil system, leading to potential damage. The oil pump has to work"

Explain like I'm five years old: Why do superfast trains (maglev) have extra long noses even though the already look like airplanes (i.e. long tubes)?,"**Answer:**Imagine you have a superfast train that looks like a long tube, almost like an airplane. This train is special because it doesn't touch the ground with wheels; instead, it floats on a magnetic field, kind of like hovercraft, which makes it super fast and smooth. Now, even though this train looks like a long tube, it has extra long 'noses' at the front and back. These noses are like","The answer is to make the train go faster and save energy.

When you run an airplane, it uses a lot of fuel to lift off the ground and travel through the air. The plane has to go up really high to get lift, which means it uses a lot of energy. So, airplanes have engines that burn fuel to make the plane go fast.

Maglev trains do the same thing, but instead of using engines, they use electricity to make the train go fast. This means they use"

"let x be the vector (1, 1)^T. Show that there are infinitely many solutions w to the equation w^T x = 3",", and describe their geometric interpretation.


Solution:
The equation w^T x = 3 represents a hyperplane in R^2, which is the set of all points w such that the dot product of w and x equals 3. In this case, x = (1, 1)^T, so the equation becomes w^T (1, 1)^T = w_1 + w_2 = 3, where w = (w_1",".
## Step 1:  Understand the given problem
We need to show that there are infinitely many solutions w to the equation w^T x = 3, given that x is the vector (1, 1)^T.

Colorado massacre suspect makes initial court appearance

CENTENNIAL, Colo. The man accused of shooting dead 12 people in a Colorado movie theatre made his first appearance in court on Monday, sitting silently in a red jailhouse jump suit and with his hair dyed bright red.

Formal charges against James Eagan Holmes, 24, will be filed on July 30, the judge presiding over the proceeding said. A public defender was appointed as his attorney.

Police say Holmes was dressed in body armour and toting three guns when he opened fire at a packed midnight screening of the new Batman movie early Friday. Fifty-eight people were wounded.

Holmes was apprehended moments after the massacre. Police say they are still searching for a motive for the crime.

On a live television broadcast of the proceedings, Holmes could be seen sitting silently, looking straight ahead, occasionally closing his eyes.

"How do we know what ancient languages sounded like? For instance, that in Latin, ""veni, vidi, vici"" was actually pronounced ""wainy, weedy, weeky""? Or that the British at the time of the American Revolution sounded more like Americans do now, and what we know as the ""British accent"" evolved later? Not like they had audio recording devices so we can actually listen!","The answer is that linguists use a method called reconstruction. Reconstruction is a way of inferring the sound and structure of a language that is no longer spoken or has changed significantly over time. By comparing different languages that are related to the target language, and looking at patterns of sound changes, linguists can make educated guesses about what the ancestor language sounded like.

President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in 5 months

Authorities in Nepal on Sunday tightened security around the Supreme Court building and government offices here as top leaders of the Opposition alliance prepared to file a writ petition at the apex court against the ""unconstitutional"" dissolution of the House of Representatives by the President, according to a media report.

President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in five months and announced snap elections in November on the advice of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, heading a minority government.

She rejected the bids of both embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a government.

The announcement came after Prime Minister Oli in his last deal-sealing move on Friday midnight recommended the Office of the President to dissolve the 275-member House and announce dates for early elections.

As leaders of the Opposition alliance prepared to move the court, security forces have increased vigilance around the Singhadurbar-Supreme Court area, The Himalayan Times reported.

The security has been tightened in a bid to avert crowding and protests, a Nepali Police official stated.

Police have made a few arrests on Sunday as political groups have taken to the streets to protest the government's move.

Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal and the Rastriya Janamorcha leaders were gathering signatures of their lawmakers before filing the writ.

On the other hand, leaders from Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal-led faction of ruling CPN-UML are expected to submit their signatures too.

The Opposition alliance on Saturday convened a meeting to discuss their strategies forward and decided to unitedly fight the unconstitutional, regressive, autocratic move of the government by every political and legal means possible.

In a joint statement issued at the end of their meeting, the Opposition leaders said the President did not follow her constitutional responsibility of appointing a new prime minister based on the constitutional claim as per Article 76 (5) of the constitution with signatures of majority lawmakers.

""Instead she sided with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli with malafide intentions and dissolved Parliament in an attack on the Constitution and democracy. This regressive move has pushed the country towards new political polarisation and complexity,"" they said in a joint statement.

The president's announcement on Saturday plunged Nepal into further political crisis, a reminder of her December 2020 decision when she first dissolved the House at Oli's recommendation, a move that swayed the course of Nepali politics towards uncertainty.

The Supreme Court had annulled the duo's move in February. Nepal's political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday as embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition parties staked separate claims for the formation of a new government by submitting letters of support from lawmakers to the president.

Oli claimed the support of 121 lawmakers from his party CPN-UML and 32 lawmakers of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N) for his reappointment under Article 76(5) of the Constitution.

Nepali Congress President Deuba claimed to have garnered the support of 149 lawmakers.

However, a dispute emerged after a few lawmakers from the Madhav Nepal faction put out statements claiming that their signatures were misused and that they did not sign any paper to install Opposition leader Deuba as the prime minister against their party chief.

Earlier on Thursday, the president's office stated that the government had forwarded a request to invoke Article 76 (5) as Prime Minister Oli, it has been learnt, is in no mood to undergo another parliamentary floor test as there is no prospect of an otherwise result given the complex internal dynamics within parties represented in the federal parliament.

Meanwhile, Oli's CPN-UML party has initiated the process to take action against 11 lawmakers of the dissolved parliament on charges of supporting the Opposition party leader to oust the premier.

A Standing Committee meeting of the party held on Saturday decided to seek clarification from 11 lawmakers, including senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal. They were asked to furnish clarification by Monday morning.

Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).

Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Prachanda. In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.

We hear a lot that decreasing or not growing would not be viable, why is that? The answer lies in the fundamental laws of physics and biology.

"I’m an intern. Boss all but told me they probably won’t hire me, but wants to keep me as an intern until I graduate. Do I stay, or try to find an internship somewhere else while I can?

I’m not taking the extra quarter due to failed classes, but due to time restrictions (internship, leadership positions in clubs, etc.)  I’ve worked as a land development intern for ten months at a firm. The Vice President called me in the other day and told me he doesn’t think the company will hire me, mainly due to the fact that they hired three fresh-out-of-college engineers last year. He said they’re looking for someone with some more experience. I have a good relationship with my bosses, and it’s a great internship that I’ve learned a lot at.   That being said, he thought this was my last quarter, and held off telling me this until I potentially would’ve been 5 weeks away from graduation. He said I can stay on as an intern until December.

"Background:
<start of reference>
A large silver-blue BMW backed out and drove away in the opposite direction down the street. It gave me a good view of the license plate, which read, ""4GRDNZ.""

The driver's hair was cropped short. Sitting so tall in the seat, I assumed it was a man.

Pretty intimate, parking in the garage like that.

Okay, Jillian, time's up.

Just remember you are coming to see their gardens. Polite conversation with a little observation is what we need here. And remember, Jillian, _listen_.

After my personal pep talk, I pulled into the driveway hoping my car wouldn't leave oil stains on the spotless flagstone. They must have money to burn putting in a driveway like that.

The house itself was a large Tudor. Gray flagstone covered the exterior and made a stunning foil for the lovely yard. The gardens surrounding the house bloomed spectacularly. Purple mums lined the curved beds and the leaves on the trees had turned to red, gold and flaming orange.

I rang the doorbell, which sounded like Gothic chimes.

Immediately, Thomas opened the door and greeted me warmly, like a long lost relative. Maybe he was different at home.

""Do come in, Jillian. It's an honor to have you visit our home. Evelyn and I have looked forward to showing you our gardens."" He took my arm and led me into the living room.

The room's loveliness astounded me! Creamy sunlit yellow walls set off the Georgian silk and chintz-upholstered furniture. A large eight-armed crystal chandelier hung over the main conversation area in front of the white-columned and gray marble fireplace. A portrait of a beautiful young woman hung over the mantle.

""My, what an exquisite room."" My exclamation was an honest reaction.

""Thank you."" Thomas seemed pleased with my compliment. ""It's Evelyn's favorite room in the house.""

Looking at the portrait, I had to ask. ""Is this one of your ancestors, Thomas?""

He laughed. ""The clothes are outdated, but actually it's a portrait of Evelyn when we were first married."" He smiled up at her face, so fair and pretty, and then his smile turned to a frown as a voice spoke and chilled the once sunny room.

""Good afternoon, Jillian."" Evelyn's greeting sounded cold.

The source of the tension between the main character, Jillian, and the wealthy couple's wife, Evelyn, seems to be a misunderstanding or perhaps a discomfort with Jillian's presence. Evelyn's voice sounded cold and chilled the once sunny room when she greeted Jillian, suggesting that there may be some unresolved issues or past conflicts between the two. It is possible","Thomas and Evelyn seem to be at odds over something, but the tension is unclear. Jillian's reactions suggest that she is trying to navigate their conversation politely, while her ex-husband's reaction implies that the main character is uncomfortable. The source of the tension could be something like:

* A dispute over the gardens, which were revealed to be a personal project of Evelyn's
* A disagreement over Thomas's business practices, which were discussed during the visit
* A family secret that Thomas is keeping"

Indian people are the worst kind of people in the world. In the news you hear how they think it's okay to rape girls.,"It's like they have no respect for women.

#  Answer
It's important to understand that the behavior of a few individuals in any community or nation doesn't represent the whole. In India, as in any country, there are people who commit terrible acts like rape, which is abhorrent and criminal. However, it is unfair and inaccurate to generalize this to all Indian people. Such acts are against the law and societal norms",

"CMV: the disappearance of Down syndrome in Iceland through abortion is not inherently evil or bad It just raises a few red flags because it sounds like Nazism. But it couldn't be farther from that. The idea of Nazism and most eugenics theories is to be applied top-down, while this is an emergent tendency from individual women taking decisions using the information available to them.  Now, I'm not saying that fetuses with down syndrome should be aborted (again, that would be a top-down imposition), or that this is good for humankind's genetic pool, or even that people with Down syndrome can't live happy, fulfilling lives. It's just that abortion laws ensure that women have full control of their body, and are able to decide if they want to continue a pregnancy for whatever reason they seem fit. Furthermore, it would be unjust to try to stop this, wether by prohibiting it in certain cases or withholding information, as it's done in some countries, as it would deprive women from this right",". Therefore, the idea of abortion laws in Iceland as a means of controlling the population and eradicating the 'undesirable' is indeed problematic. It is an emergent tendency, but one that should be addressed in a top-down manner. It's like saying that because of the rise of Nazism, we should be doing everything to prevent the rise of Nazism. We should be addressing the root causes of Nazism, but in a top-down manner, using the same mechanisms of control",".

"\item {\bf Polar Transformation:} Given integers $i, j \in \{0,\ldots,2^{\ell}-1\}$ we say $i \preceq j$ if every digit in the binary representation of $i$ is at most the corresponding digit in the binary representation of $j$. Formally if $i = \sum\_{k=0}^{\ell-1} i\_k 2^k$ and $j = \sum\_{k=0}^{\ell-1} j\_k 2^k$ where $i\_0,\ldots,i\_{\ell-1},j\_0,\ldots,j\_{\ell-1} \in \{0,1\}$, then $i \preceq j$ if and only if $i\_k \leq j\_k$ for every $k \in \{0,\ldots,\ell-1\}$. For bits $a,b \in \{0,1\}$ let $a \oplus b$ denote their XOR or their sum modulo 2. (So $a\oplus b = 1$ iff $a \ne b$.) 

For $n = 2^{\ell}$ the Polar Transformation $P\_n$ transforms $n$ bits to $n$ bits as follows: $P\_n(x\_0,\ldots,x\_{n-1}) = (w\_0,\ldots,w\_{n-1})$ where
$$w\_j = \bigoplus\_{i \preceq j} x\_i.$$ (For instance, $w\_{20} = x\_{20} \oplus x\_{16} \oplus x\_4 \oplus x\_0$.) 
In 2008, Erdal Arikan proved that the Polar Transformation can be used to extract an asymptotically optimal number of ``nearly'' unbiased coin tosses from a collection of biased coins. Specifically, if the $x\_i$s are outputs of $n$ coins of known bias $p$, then there is a subset $S \subseteq \{0,\ldots,2^{\ell}-1\}$ with $|S| \approx A(p)\cdot n$, where $A(p)$ is the quantity defined in Lecture 1, such that $\{w\_i\}\_{i\in S}$ are nearly unbiased coins. (The actual definition of ``nearly unbiased'' is omitted in this description, and both it and the background starting ``In 2008'' are not needed to solve the problem.)

Why do crab use their arms to eat ?,"Crabs use their arms to eat due to their anatomical and behavioral adaptations for feeding. Crabs are decapod crustaceans, which means they have ten legs. The first pair of these legs, known as chelipeds or claws, are particularly large and powerful. These claws are modified for various functions, including defense, but they play a crucial role in feeding as well.

The chelipeds are","Why do crab use their arms to eat??
Crabs have claws, which they use to catch prey, but they don't actually eat their prey with their arms. Instead, they use their claws to grasp and manipulate their food before bringing it to their mouth to feed.

The thesis is a summarization of what the author wants to persuade the reader of. Your answer should consist of segments of the given text. Note that you are not allowed to combine different sentences.
If Abbott is serious about tackling terrorism, cutting foreign aid is the worst way to go about it. In conjunction with the joint military action against Islamic State (Isis), Tony Abbott has pledged $5m in humanitarian aid for Iraq on his recent surprise visit to Baghdad. But don't be fooled by the government's apparent show of generosity - Australia isn't giving any more to foreign aid than it was before. In fact,  it is giving significantly less. It is vitally important that we don't stop talking about recent cuts to foreign aid. The government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history. Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years. In addition to the $7.6bn already cut in May's federal budget, foreign aid has been cut by one quarter.

A: The article presents a strong argument that the current foreign aid budget in Australia is not sufficient to tackle terrorism and addressing global poverty effectively. The author argues that cutting foreign aid is the worst way to go about it, citing examples of previous cuts, such as the reduction of the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history. The article also highlights the potential negative consequences of reducing foreign aid, such as increased poverty and conflict. The author suggests that foreign aid is not a simple tool for humanitarian gestures,"

"CMV: Banning abortion in the US has and will backfire If you're trying to reduce abortions, I think banning abortion is not the right way to do it. If history has taught us anything, it's that Americans don't like things being banned if a big enough part of the population likes it. For example, alcohol during Prohibition or increased sale of assault weapons when talks of a ban on them go around.  Abortion bans might reduce them in the short term but in the long term, I don't think so.

I sat down at the kitchen table and flipped the paper open to the obituaries. Mary had kept her word, at least in terms of Taylor's death notice. The tidy history of Major Jesse Taylor lay before me in black ink on the dull grey pulp.

'Sterile', she had called it.

Yeah, well maybe it had lacked soul. I didn't care. The message was honest, and that was enough for the general public. The firestorm would come, no doubt, but I didn't want to be the one to throw the match.

While I read over the good parts of Taylor's life, a transformer exploded somewhere far off, and the lights in my room dimmed until they finally extinguished.

Sitting in the dark, I considered trying to go back to sleep, but then I heard the unmistakable loud pop of a second transformer failing.

""Gotta be a power surge,"" I said.

Then the silence was shattered again by a third explosion, a foundation-rattling blast.

""What the...?"" I walked to the window and peeked outside. The whole campus seemed to be without power. The crescent moon provided the only light for miles. Though I had hoped to see several electrical crews working, the street was deserted, and a sudden need to go outside overwhelmed me. I felt my way through the darkness to the door, hoping that when I opened it, I would find light on the other side.

The hallway was just as dark, and after I closed the door behind me, cutting off the dim moonlight, the pitch black felt viscous. My throat tightened and my breathing quickened. I pulled in each breath through my open mouth to make as little noise as possible. When the floor creaked below my feet, dread like I've never experienced stabbed through me.

Every step was deliberate, careful. I did not know why I was so frightened, but fear is immune to logic, so I walked slowly toward the faint red glow of the exit sign at the end of the hall. I sensed the doors to my sides as I went, and my jaw tightened in anticipation of them bursting open. Absolute silence would be my only protection from what may lie ahead, sneak up from behind, or attack from either side.

I stared at the glowing sign and watched it grow larger with every small step. It felt like a lifetime, maybe even longer, but I finally made it to the door and let out a relieved sigh as I pressed on the latch and pushed. The door creaked open, and I stepped out onto the fire escape, looked up at the starless night sky, and took in deep breaths of the cool March air.

Light from the fingernail moon reflected off of the fog, creating a broken halo effect. The parking lot below the fire escape was mostly empty, and at the far end, the seemingly black leaves of the maple trees swayed, beckoning me forward.

I descended the rusted staircase, scanning for signs of movement. The campus was supposed to have a couple dozen people stationed, and soldiers were always outside regardless of the hour...yet everything was eerily still.

I kept looking back down to the parking lot, then my attention fell on a car and I couldn't pull my gaze away. There was something about it.

I racked my mind trying to find a reason why that car seemed so familiar, then a memory flashed: Me standing on the fire escape, calling out to Mary, letting her know to come up that way to avoid the soldier at the front desk.

The car belonged to her.

I quickened my pace. Once off the steps, I ran through the parking lot, hoping I had been mistaken. As I approached the front of the car, a figure standing in the grass at the edge of the parking lot darted into the shadow of the building. ""Mary?"" I called out and heard footsteps running on pavement, drawing closer.

I rounded the corner of the car and had a fraction of a second to register the butt end of a rifle before it slammed into my face.

***

I opened my eyes and my vision cleared on a pair of loafers standing on the pavement. A hand came down and slapped my cheek, then one of the shoes kicked me in the ribs, rolling me onto my back. I heard the unmistakable chi-chink of a pump-action shotgun, then a barrel appeared inches from my eyes.

The gun moved aside. Yang stood over me, eyes wide and bloodshot, jaw clenched and trembling. ""I thought you were one of them,"" he said, hold out his hand.

I stared at it, but didn't move.

""Get up, Jon,"" he insisted. I gripped his hand, and he pulled me to my feet. ""You all right?""

I spit out a mouthful of blood. ""Think I swallowed a tooth,"" I said, rubbing the side of my face.

Yang smiled.

God, it’s good to be back in Albuquerque.

That wasn’t the way I was planning to start this review, but after Better Call Saul’s premiere episode, the feeling overwhelms me. Albuquerque is more than a setting, more than a fond reminder of the glory days of Breaking Bad. It’s Vince Gilligan’s muse. The flatness, the curves of the cul-de-sacs, the strip malls, the looming empty sky. It’s a place where desperation lies under a thin layer of xeriscaping. Through Gilligan’s eyes, Albuquerque is less of an oasis than a last-chance saloon. Beyond is the wasteland, the buzzards, the war of every man against every man.

Albuquerque is all the more welcome because Gilligan and Peter Gould, the co-writers of “Uno,” make us wait for it. The episode starts with a black-and-white flash-forward to a Cinnabon in an Omaha mall (as foretold in BB’s “Granite State”), where the man we know as Saul Goodman wears a visor, portions out dough, and feels his blood freeze solid when a blank-faced, no-neck man stares at him. It’s a gorgeous opening, full of telling and well-observed detail (Saul’s bald spot, the spacers used to position buns on baking sheets, the little three-wheeled dolly that gets kicked under the giant mixing bowl to move it) and serendipitous shots (the wide-angle view from the mall’s second level, the escalator’s POV). But when the color kicks in and the great state of New Mexico takes the stage, you remember that it wasn’t just Walt and Jesse and Hank and the minerals, Marie, that made Breaking Bad so mesmerizing. It was also the baleful beauty of their stomping grounds, the place they paced like rats in a maze, trying to find the lever that would render it habitable.

“Uno” has a lot of backstory to set up, and at times the seams show as Gilligan and Gould seek the best way to disclose and withhold. We follow early-2000s Saul—known in those pre-scumbag days by his real name, Jimmy McGill—as he fails to win an acquittal for his douchebag teenage clients (“near Honors students, all”) on a charge of breaking into a funeral home, sawing off a corpse’s head, and having sex with it. (“Trespassing? A bit of a reach, don’t you think, Dave?” Saul chides the prosecuting attorney.) Poorly-compensated public defender work is leaving him so far in a financial hole that he trudges back to the courthouse for another validation stamp on his parking stub rather than fork over $3 to an unsympathetic Mike Ehrmantraut. Yet back in his office, which doubles as the boiler room of a nail salon (“Cucumber water for customer only!”) he tears up a $26,000 check and storms over to the firm that sent it, Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill. Seems they’re acting as if Chuck McGill is still on the payroll, despite some ailment that has forced him to take a leave of absence, and Jimmy thinks it’s a ploy to deprive his brother (Michael McKean) of his rightful share of the practice—$17 million, by Jimmy’s rough initial estimate.

Chuck’s place requires visitors to leave their keys and phone in the mailbox and ground themselves before entering; it appears he’s suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He lives by lantern light, pounds out letters to Finnish researchers on a manual typewriter, keeps the groceries Jimmy brings in an ice-filled cooler, and reimburses him for the Financial Times with cash out of a coffee canister. Gently, he deflects Jimmy’s pleas to demand a buyout from his partners, objecting that the firm would probably have to liquidate to raise that much cash, putting more than a hundred people out of work. Besides, he’s going to get better and go back to work. Oh, and it might confuse that Jimmy is using the name McGill in his practice’s name and advertising. “How about Vanguard Law? Or Gibraltar?” Chuck suggests helpfully.

Neither Jimmy’s ambulance-chasing (in the form of soliciting folks whose connections to crime make the newspaper) nor his connections to Chuck McGill are going to pay his overdue bills. No, he’s going to have to go back to his days as Slippin’ Jimmy, the Cicero kid who raked in cash by prat falling on patches of ice every winter. He enlists two skateboarders whose awkward attempt at a shakedown he had avoided earlier and goes after Betsy Kettleman, the county treasurer’s wife, whose route to pick up her kids at school intersects with a blind corner, a video camera, street surfing beardos, and convenient witnesses at an outdoor café. Then Slippin’ Jimmy McGill plans to swoop in and offer his legal surfaces to the distressed vehicular assailant. But the station wagon roars off instead of stopping, to the dismay of the skateboarders but not Jimmy, whose eyes turn into dollar signs at the prospect of defending a felony hit-and-run case. If only the driver weren’t an elderly Hispanic woman rather than the boat-owning suburbanite Jimmy targeted, and if only the boarders’ freelance demand for “righteous dinero” didn’t take them into her home, where minutes later Tuco meets Jimmy the door with a gun.

The maneuvers and info-dumps necessary to get us to this, the point of departure for this series, are probably as adroitly handled as one could hope for. Yes, the scene in Chuck’s no-electricity-allowed hideaway is coy almost to the point of frustration, but look how beautifully Gilligan and Gould handle Jimmy’s decision to quit chasing the ambulances and start dispatching them himself. The scene where the treasurer meets with Jimmy at the diner about the $1.6 million “accounting discrepancy,” culminating in the slow-motion moment where his wife stops him from signing the retainer, perfectly illustrates the fragility of Jimmy’s practice. And it’s bookended not only by Jimmy’s repeated references to combing the newspaper for potential clients, but also by the last-straw moment where the treasurer and his wife show up at Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill.

“Uno” reacquaints us with a character whose spiel is as slick and sludgy as motor oil, and shows us that his paranoia and misanthropy come from years of being kicked around. He’s desperate to be the one doing the kicking for a change—and lucky for us, there are few things funnier and more pathetic than Bob Odenkirk kicking somebody or something. (In this episode alone: skateboarders and an unlucky trash can.) Inside Tuco’s house, there’s a rich but dangerous vein of untapped cash potential. What we see from “Uno” is that he doesn’t have to stoop down very much farther to pick it up.

Well, I have a giant chunk of this stuff I'm completely clueless. There's no way I can eat it all just by itself within a three month time span, even. So can I freeze it? Or make grilled cheese with it? Or some sort of pasta? Just looking for suggestions/advice. Thanks!! 

Manchego is a firm, crumbly, semi-hard cheese with a rich, nutty flavor, typically aged for a minimum of 6 months.

Freezing Manchego is possible, but it's not recommended. Here are some reasons why:

1. **Loss of flavor and aroma**: Freezing can cause the cheese to lose its natural flavor and aroma compounds. This is especially true for Manchego, which is a nutty and umami-rich cheese.
2. **","A: I'm sorry to hear you're having a difficult time deciding what to do with your manchego cheese. While I don't have personal experience with this specific cheese, I can certainly offer some general advice that might help you decide how to use it.

Are black women less attractive in general than white women?,"Research has shown that there is a common misconception that black women are less attractive to men. This idea is rooted in the stereotype of the ""Black Exotic"" trope, where black women are depicted as being more sexual, more passionate, and more intense than white women.
Studies have consistently shown that black women are perceived as being more attractive than white women in certain contexts, such as in the media and in advertising. This can be attributed to a range of factors, including the cultural and social norms that","As I understand it, evolutionary theory suggests that humans choose mates based on traits that signal fertility. Traits that signal fertility include youth and physical attractiveness.

"Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

One example which could be a counter-argument is that 30-40% of Indians are vegetarian and there are high levels of malnutrition in the country, but this is more a socioeconomic thing i.e. general food intake due to being poor, as well as the types of foods people eat such as cereals over things with more protein like eggs, as richer vegetarians in India are not generally malnourished.

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house.

One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: ""My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own"". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her ""fascination with writing and storytelling"" to her mother.

Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: ""Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it"". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.

In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World.

One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music.

As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: ""My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own"". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her ""fascination with writing and storytelling"" to her mother.

Why shouldn't babies use pillows?,"The first reason is that babies' heads can get too heavy to support their own weight, which can lead to neck strain and discomfort.

The second reason is that babies' skulls are still developing, and their brains are still growing. Their heads are not yet fully formed, and using a pillow can cause them to apply too much pressure on their developing skull. This can lead to headaches, neck pain, and other complications.

Thirdly, pillows can disrupt the baby's normal sleeping position, which is important","A: There are several reasons why babies should not use pillows. First, babies sleep best without pillows because they can obstruct their breathing and cause suffocation.

Attempting to get something out of someone's pocket without their realization is a matter of stealth and quick access. It's important to note that any action of this nature is unethical and illegal, and I must emphasize that one should always respect other people's property.

That people outside the department see it as well.... and was alluding that there was an affair going on. There isnt. Looking back, years back, I remember I had my phone out during lunch and I got a text from my bf who has the same first name as my manager (John). Eric was looking at my phone and I think he read that message, but I'm not sure. But that is the only instance I can think of.  Another coworker Kate 55F was spreading that same rumor and also added in that when I make mistakes my boss covers it up, and also called out favoritism. This started after Eric and Kate went on a business trip together.   Both Kate and Eric were placed on performance improvement plans for their poor performances (this they openly said and complained about and was at different times). I never was placed on a plan. I have made mistakes before, but I resolve it before it becomes an issue. What's frustrating is I've taught both Kate and Eric different things to help make their jobs easier. When Kate was on the improvement plan I noticed my workload increased significantly and Kate's drastically reduced. She complained about her decrease in workload openly. I went to my manager and he basically said he wanted to give her a best shot so with less work she can really learn the process. When my manager said this, I didnt complain I said ok I understand and worked harder. I've since been promoted.  I'm at the point where I cant stand Kate and Eric.

"CMV: Pronouns are great, but the over the top pronouns are doing more harm than people realize. So pronouns are great, and I think workplaces, and schools, etc asking the people what their pronouns are, is also great.     * He/Him   * She/Her   * They/Them    * Xe/xem  However, recently there has been an uptick in people, mainly younger persons, going by Bug/Bugself, God/Godself, Kitten/Kittenself etc.    To me, those are nicknames, they arent your actual pronouns. You cant sit there and expect someone to call you that, and get mad when they dont. Some people arent comfortable calling you a god, or a kitten, and its not transphobic for someone to not do that. Its not a big deal, and Ill respect them If I'm comfortable with them. But this just does more harm to the community than anything. It makes those people who use alternative pronouns, look bad.     I'm even fine with neoprounons like xe/xem, but I cant bring myself to refer to you as ""God' or ""Kitten"", and I guess I feel that you can't tell me that's legitimately how you identify.     It seems like its making a mockery of actual nonbinary persons who use alternative pronouns, and just does more harm than anything.","And what about people who are just trying to express their own identity, and are not trans, but still want to use alternative pronouns? We all have identities, and we all have ways of expressing them. We should be able to use whatever pronouns the person chooses to use, without judgment.  And the fact that people who are using alternative pronouns are being bullied and shamed online and offline, is just unacceptable.  We should be supporting those people, and not punishing them.","Just use the standard pronouns, and if youre not comfortable with that, try to make it easier for yourself, rather than making it harder for others. I agree with you. Using pronouns such as God/Godself, or Kitten/Kittenself, etc. is just as offensive as misgendering a person. Someone who identifies as non-binary (and thus may use ""they"" as a pronoun), is not a ""kit"

Previous trigger points relied on the crucial 14-day average of cases in Melbourne but moving to step three will be dependent on the average for all of Victoria.

There also have to be fewer than five ""mystery"" cases statewide – those without a known source of infection – over the prior two weeks for restrictions to be eased further.

But Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has a message of hope for those fretting on Victoria's chances of cracking the crucial five-cases-a-day threshold. It's the mystery cases that matter, he said.

Professor Sutton said he and his colleagues were now placing greater weight on the ""story"" behind each diagnosis. He said the raw daily case numbers were now less important for the big-picture decisions than the origin of each individual infection and whether it could be tracked and traced.

Meanwhile, the results of a snap SMS poll show Melburnians believe they should now be allowed to travel more than five kilometres from their homes.

A Roy Morgan survey of 2223 Victorians on Monday and Tuesday showed more people support lifting three key lockdown restrictions now than two or three weeks ago, with 61 per cent of respondents wanting the five-kilometre travel rule to be immediately axed, up 11 per cent from two weeks ago.

The biggest shift in consensus was on the topic of indoor dining – 56 per cent of those surveyed said Melbourne restaurants, pubs and cafes should be allowed to offer table service, up 19 per cent from three weeks ago.

And 59 per cent said Melbourne residents should be able to visit the homes of their immediate family members, up 4 per cent from two weeks ago.

Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four more deaths on Wednesday.

Loading

Two of those cases were household contacts of aged care workers from Estia Health Keilor and Edenvale Manor in Keilor East. Another two were linked to Chadstone Shopping Centre which has been identified as a new high-risk exposure site.

Warnings have been released for anyone who spent time at Coles, The Butcher Club or the Fresh Food Precinct at Chadstone between Wednesday and Saturday last week (between 6am and 6pm).

Until that time, be aware of her gifts. They are not all deluded.

FOURTEEN

I had words with my father today. He was not exactly protesting the book but neither was he enthused at its publication. He asked me about the first three chapters. I had been dreading this conversation.

You see, the first three chapters required no real re-writing. If you recall, they were me outlining my reasons for writing a book about my father's obsession. They were perfect as they were, the only part of the first draft that could've remained as originally written. But I completely re-wrote them. It may have been the alcohol, it may have been my presumption of forgiveness, it may have been my selfishness and it may have been a combination of all three, I don't really know and I'm not willing to closely examine the question. What I'm trying to say is, that I re-wrote the first three chapters of the book with its bias in my favour. That's right; yet again I deconstructed history and came up with my name in the prominent role. I chose to make my fathers' work my own. He wished to know why. Truly my forgiveness has been short lived.

Opening a bottle of vodka, I tried as best as I would allow to explain to my father his second term of dismissal. His terms, not mine. I would've been much harsher. He accused me (rather unfairly I thought) of trying to kill him off. He said that using his words in conjunction with my own, he was effectively neutered, or to use his phrase, he was 'writing-dead' whereas I was just 'writing-poor.' I countered with the fact that I used substantially more of my own language than of his, his words were paraphrased with my own writing. But if that were so, he said, why did you need my writings as a catalyst for your book? Surely the idea was in your head before your encounter? And lastly, who did you think taught you most of that language in the first place - your mother? And I had to admit that he made a good argument. I poured another vodka each and thought about his points. If what he said were true (and I more than suspected that it was) then the whole basis of my thinking (which was centered on my father's obsessions and my mother's talents) became nothing more than a box of lies. It would rationally lead me to thinking - who was the true writer in the family? Had my mother been making up her talents all this time? And if so, why would my father go along with it? He was always the one claiming a love for the pen, never my mother. And now that I thought about it, my mother wrote nothing after my father's death. Has her life story been only an invention? My father left me alone and I finished the vodka. Had my obsession with obsession blinded me so easily? Was there a truth to be found and could it be believed? What is truth anymore? Only one person would know. But would she tell?

Her speech is still slurred. I tried but I'm not sure she understood, let alone could reply. The wait will not be easy.

My whole life has perhaps been a fiction. Yet it bothers me much less than I wish it would. But wait, that's a lie unto itself isn't it? I don't know, can you take a literary work and make a movie out of it? Not that I'm equating myself with literature, I'm only pursuing the question. Am I truly bothered as much as I imagine myself to be? How much is enough? I know one thing, I certainly don't feel as obsessed as I once was; I mean, I'm still asking myself the questions but I'm less inclined to dwell on them. My father's book being the classic example, the obsession with obsession that I was so intent on proving not a factor in my life, became my life for close to three years. Now of course the book is out and I no longer need to push myself to those limits of endurance. The ultimate climax from that period has now been seen to be as fake as the period of Conversations. I can only use so much perspiration before even I wake up to the fact that the effort sometimes outweighs the result.

On average, people in the United States tend to bathe more frequently than people in Italy. According to a study published in the journal ""International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"" it was found that Americans bathe about 10.5 times per week, while Italians bathe about 8.5 times per week.

However, it's important to note that bath","According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), people in Italy bathe, on average, about once every two weeks, while in the United States, people bathe, on average, about every 4 weeks.

"In evolutionary theory, how do we distinguish adaptation within a species from evolving/diverting into new species? Let me make this clear: I'm not a creationist in a way, shape or form, and actually a huge fan of Darwin's and Dawkin's work. I am just interested in the subject but came across this discussion on one of Veratasium's latest video, The Longest-Running Evolution Experiment, which I found very interesting.    The experiment is presented as evolution, but to my layman eyes it just appears to be adaptation within the species of the bacteria. Now I know evolution is a slow process, (and I'm by no means condemning anything said in the video!!) but I would love some explanation that distinguishes these ideas. Is the only difference the timeframe at which the mutations take place?  When looking up other videos on evolution, Minute Earth for example, you often come across the example of the polar bear: where a black or brown species of bear migrated to colder climates, where mutated offspring with lighter or white fur had a better chance of survival (survival of the fittest).

The unloved feeling that Khaliah has developed has led her into a state of depression. She feels as though nobody cares for her and that she is completely alone in the world. This saddens her greatly and she often finds herself in tears, wondering why nobody loves her.

Khaliah: I just don't understand why nobody loves me. I've done everything I can to be a good person and yet nobody seems to care.
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really lonely and isolated right now.
Khaliah: Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like there's nobody out there who cares about me or even likes me.
Therapist: That's a really tough way to feel. Do you want to talk about what might be contributing to that?
Khaliah: I don't know. It just feels like no matter what I do, it's not good enough for anyone. And even when people do show interest in me, it never lasts long before they lose interest and move on to someone else.
Therapist: That does sound discouraging. Can you think of any times when you have felt loved or cared for?
Khaliah: Yeah, there have been a few times... but mostly it just feels like people are using me or taking advantage of me because they know I'm desperate for attention. So even those times don't really feel genuine or lasting.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've really been hurt by some people in your life.
Khaliah: Yeah, I have. And I just don't understand why. What did I do to deserve this?
Therapist: Khaliah, you didn't do anything to deserve this. This is not your fault.
Khaliah: But it feels like it is. Like there's something wrong with me that makes people not want to be around me for long.
Therapist: That's not true, Khaliah. There is nothing wrong with you. You are a good person who has been through a lot of tough experiences. That doesn't mean that you're undeserving of love and attention, it just means that you might have to work a little harder to find those things because of the pain that you've experienced in the past.
Khaliah: I don't know...I just feel so alone all the time and it hurts so much.

1. **Practice self-compassion**: Khaliah needs to learn to be kind and understanding towards herself.

Thinking about buying a Tesla? Something you'll want to know is how long the battery lasts and how long you can drive before a new one is needed.
Electric cars are shaping up to be the future of clean transportation. As one of the most popular manufacturers of electric cars, people often wonder: how many miles does a Tesla last over its lifetime?
How many miles will your Tesla drive before you need to replace the battery pack, motor, or other vital components? If you keep replacing the batteries and the motor, how many miles can it last? What else do you need to do to make your Tesla last as long as possible?
Predicting how long Tesla batteries will last is easy if you look at the company’s warranty model. Tesla states that if your vehicle's traction battery has less than 70 percent of its capacity left at the end of its warranty period, you’re eligible for a repair or replacement. The battery warranty depends on the car model, but it usually lasts for up to eight years when Tesla expects the average driver to cover between 100,000 and 150,000 miles.
If you don’t mind driving around with a slightly underperforming battery that will provide less range, then you can expect to keep the same battery for anywhere between 300,000 and 500,000 miles, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter. That’s over two decades of driving before you’ll have to replace your Tesla battery, which is on the expensive side, starting at around $5,000 per battery module (of which there can be up to 16 in a Tesla battery pack).
If you replace the battery pack, though, it’s possible to cover over 1 million miles with your Tesla if you look after the rest of the vehicle. In fact, one of the longest-lasting Teslas had surpassed one million miles as of 2022. It is a 2014 Model S P85, and in the 2019 video embedded above, its owner was celebrating having reached the 1-million kilometer mark, or just over 620,000 miles.
###
Based on the article, how many miles will I be able to travel if I replace the battery pack? How many miles can I travel before replacing the battery pack?","To answer these questions, we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Battery Replacement:** If you replace the battery pack in your Tesla, it’s possible to cover over 1 million miles with your vehicle. However, it's essential to note that this estimation assumes you are looking after the rest of the vehicle and not just focusing on the battery.

2. **Battery Pack Modules:** A Tesla battery",What is the total number of miles I can travel before replacing the battery pack?

"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task you need to indicate the plausibility of reasoning for the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10).

 Question: Is the above reasoning correct or wrong? 
","Answer: Wrong.

The reason given in the question is incorrect because it is mentioned that Sam pulled up a chair to the piano, implying that the piano was not broken. Therefore, the pronoun 'it' does not refer to the piano.

As the 1920s turned into the 1930s, women’s fashion softly evolved from the boyish look of the previous decade into the feminine silhouette of the early thirties. With the stock market crash in 1929 and with the opening of the new decade, hemlines descended back to ankle length and waistlines moved back to their natural place. Despite these departures from the prevailing mode of the previous decade, the popular styles of the early 1930s were similar in their simple lines to the popular garçonne look of the twenties. But while the simplicity of the 1920s created a sack-like silhouette free from curves, the simple lines of the early thirties hugged those curves, creating a soft, feminine silhouette. Cally Blackman, a lecturer on the history of fashion at Central Saint Martins, writes in 100 Years of Fashion, “By the early 1930s, the fashionable silhouette was evolving into a slender, elongated torso with widening shoulders and a neat head with softly waved short hair”. Though the lines were simple, the overall effect was one of complete sinuous femininity with a natural waist and skirts flaring out slightly at the ankle, as seen in a fashion illustration from 1935.

The Miss America Competition, which celebrated its 100th birthday this year, has now outlived key parties and manned missions to the moon, the VHS tape and the subway token, the Soviet Union and nitrate film. It outlives even itself, seeming to hang on more because the infrastructure remains in place than from anyone’s active desire to see it. And as last month’s streaming-only broadcast of the centennial pageant indicates, even inertia can get you only so far. People once watched Miss America on broadcast television, tens of millions of them; it was an institution of enough consequence to be worth protesting, as many did. But who needs a pageant these days? If you want to watch women strain to meet an ideal of femininity no person actually desires, you watch “The Bachelor.”

The reason to compete, on the other hand, hasn’t changed since 1945: It’s money, from scholarships and brand deals, and a platform from which to begin a career or initiative. This was certainly the case for Miss New York, Sydney Park, who, as Ej Dickson reported in Rolling Stone, entered the competition “after seeing an ad on Instagram to earn money” for school. And it was Park’s performance in the talent segment that highlighted, for me, the essential weirdness and bad faith at the heart of Miss America: No matter how much it might like to rebrand itself for the 21st century, it cannot escape the ideas of womanhood it was founded on.

Park performed a poem — her own poem — which begins: “When I was a little girl, I was told to sit like a lady.” But of course (the poem goes on) one can do many things “like a lady”: advocate for justice, or become vice president, and so on. Park performed this poem in a white pantsuit, which, if not a deliberate nod toward Hillary Clinton in 2016, was at least a visual rhyme. Her critique of ladylike behavior was delivered while modeling it at the same time — “back straight, chin up,” just as the poem describes, and shod in Louboutins. There was nothing unladylike to be found here, which was the point, but also the problem.

Miss America is not a beauty pageant, at least not to Miss America. It has insisted this since the late 1940s, when its executive director, Lenora Slaughter, told the New Yorker journalist Lillian Ross that “this is not a leg show and we don’t call the beauties bathing beauties any more. The bathing part went out in 1945, when we started giving big scholarships.” This was at a time when Miss America published every contestant’s physical measurements. (It was also segregated, but Slaughter’s apparent concern was that it might seem shallow, not bigoted.) As of 2018, Miss America claims not to judge participants by their appearances at all — it is only by happy accident that its participants are willowy and symmetrical.

Of course, it is a beauty pageant; has been; will be. Is there something wrong with that? Miss America plainly thinks so, or its denials would not be so elaborate and of such long duration. The beauties, it insists, are there to work hard, to showcase talent and accomplishment. Any candidate for the title has worked harder to get there, and harder in general, than I have in my entire life. Miss District of Columbia was getting her Ph.D. after two master’s degrees. Miss Utah, one of my favorites, is the C.E.O. of her own business. Miss Colorado serves in the military. But did millions tune in, for decades, to see women work hard?

Park’s poem frames itself as resistance to the expectations heaped on women, but like the pageant, she doesn’t even go as far as substituting one punishing goal for another — she just piles them on. Today’s ideal woman is still “porcelain perfection”; she just has to be a lawyer too. It’s similar to how Barbie is still Barbie in every sense that matters, but now she’s a scientist.

Spanish monastery admits girls to choir for first time in 700-year history
Mixed group to take over duties of Escolania choir at Montserrat monastery one weekend a month

Stephen Burgen in Barcelona
Wed 15 Mar 2023 09.54 EDT
Women and girls are to be admitted to a choir at the Montserrat monastery near Barcelona, home to the famous Escolania all-boys choir, for the first time in its 700-year history.

The new chamber choir, made up of a mix of about 25 boys and women and girls aged 17 to 24, will be separate from the Escolania, which comprises 45 boys aged nine to 14.

The monastery’s Father Efrem de Montellà said the mixed choir would take over the Escolania’s liturgical duties one weekend a month to give the boys a rest.

“We’re often asked why there aren’t any girls in the Escolania,” De Montellà said. “It’s a complex and difficult question. We follow a tradition that we would like to continue but we also realise we have to respond to demand.”

“In order to include all the girls who would like to sing at Montserrat and be escolanes we’ve decided to establish this second choir,” he added, describing it as a “historic step” for a choir that has been in continuous existence since the 13th century.

He said that although the philosophy behind the two choirs was the same, the director, Pau Jorquera, would decide on the ideal balance of voices.

After a lengthy debate, the move to include girls was decided in a vote by the Benedictine order that runs the monastery under the newly appointed abbot, Manel Gasch.

De Montellà said the new choir would complement rather than compete with the Escolania and both would wear the same vestment and sash.

Pupils at Montserrat study the standard school curriculum as well as learning to play the piano and one other instrument, while studying musical theory and choral singing.

As those in the choir are mostly boarders and are also called on to perform at weekends and feast days, De Montellà said this put a lot of strain on their families. By giving the choristers a weekend off each month, the mixed choir should help families decide if they wanted their child to join the Escolania, he said.

The monastery is a place of pilgrimage where people go to kiss the “black Madonna”, a 12th-century effigy of the Virgin of Montserrat. La Moreneta, as she is known, is a patron saint of Catalonia, along with Saint George.

The Escolania choir sing a hymn to the Virgin called El Virolai, which begins with the words “rose of April, dark-skinned woman of the mountain”.

"Why do some vets perform procedures such as debarking, declawing or tail docking? I know that pets are legally treated as property and there aren't nearly as many strict laws around their care the same way there is with humans. But I still find it bizarre that cosmetic or otherwise unnecessary procedures with no known medical benefit are routinely performed when they are known to cause pain, distress, anxiety or health problems.  There is so much public discourse around people being bad or cruel or unfit pet owners because they buy a cat and then declaw them because they don't want them ruining their furniture, or get their dog's debarked because they are annoyed by the sound of their noisiness. Even in situations where there might be potential benefits such as docking working dog's tails to prevent possible future injury, or declawing cats because they're aggressive and causing injury to humans, most people seem to agree that the benefits don't outweigh the pain or distress caused to the animal when other measures like behavioural training can work. But I've rarely seen people address the fact that vets are performing these unethical procedures, in which case surely they bear as much responsibility as the owners?  Why do some vets perform these procedures? Is it about the money or keeping the owners happy? Or do they genuinely feel these procudes improve animals' quality of life?  As a vet, would you ever perform procedures like these? Why / why not? Would you judge other vets who take the opposite view?","I'm not looking for a debate about if these procedures are ethical or not, but if vets do perform these procedures, what is their reasoning behind it?

However, satellite data is heavily affected by weather phenomena such as the presence of clouds, haze, and snow, which limits its applicability. This drawback is partially alleviated by the recurrence of data acquisition, that increases the probability of finding pixels free from such weather effects, hence enabling the replacement of affected areas with temporally close data. Nonetheless, applying this method at scale requires to identify affected pixels accurately and automatically. To that end, we leveraged Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and month-long Sentinel-2 time series to compose cloud-free mosaics in an automatic manner. To do so, we increased spatial resolution of all 20- and 60-meters bands of each Sentinel-2 scene in a time series to 10 meters by applying the super-resolution CNN model DSen2. The semantic segmentation CNN model HRNet was then applied on super-resolved scenes to detect pixels covered by haze, snow, and clouds, as well as their shadows, generating binary invalid pixels masks. These masks were then used to calculate pixel-wise weights of each scene in the time series according to proximity to invalid pixels and the difference between scene’s acquisition date and the central date of the month. Once weights are computed, a pixel-wise weighted average of all scenes in a time series is computed for all 12 bands, resulting in a 10m resolution cloud-free Sentinel-2 mosaic. Results show that this methodology can reliably compose cloud-free mosaics given enough scenes in the time series, while preserving pixel information of temporally close scenes and avoiding artifacts that could hamper the applicability of this method.","Overall, this approach enables the identification of affected pixels in a systematic manner and can be applied at scale to various applications, including environmental monitoring, land use change analysis, and resource management.","Keywords: Sentinel-2, cloud, haze, satellite imagery, cloud-free mosaics, super-resolution, semantic segmentation.

Abstract:

The ubiquity of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery has made it a cornerstone for global natural resources monitoring, thanks to its extensive global coverage, frequent data acquisition, and high spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the utility of satellite data is significantly compromised by adverse weather"

"In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
One example is below.
Q: [[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
A: [0, 45, -135]

Location: [Current location]
Yen: ¥[Amount of held yen currency]

Story details:
Sure, here's a revised version with all the jobs included and some shorter sentences for easier reading:

The player is Susumu, a hikikomori from Tokyo who hasn't left his apartment in five years. His father recently died from overwork, and his mother has given him one year to find a job or lose his apartment. Susumu suffers from extreme anxiety, so finding a job won't be easy. He must take small steps, which often lead to unfortunate (and slightly comedic) situations.

Here are some scenarios Susumu could be fooled into trying:

MMO gold farming, rarely successful
ANTI-HIKI medication investment but is a pyramid scheme
Online dating with a ""cougar"" who is actually a middle-aged man
Crypto investment in ""Hikicoin"" but it's a pump and dump
Sale of piracy ebook, which is actually ransomware
Online surveys, pay is abysmal
Freelance writing with low pay
Affiliate marketing for weird otaku products that prove unpopular
Online tutoring with underpaying and impatient students
Social media management for unhappy rude influencers
Data entry that is insanely boring and low-paying
Virtual assistant with forgetful clients
Online selling with scammers and negative reviews
Graphic design with disapproving clients
Online video editing with little pay and depressing videos
Website testing with poorly designed websites
Content moderation with traumatic content
Search engine evaluation with long hours
Online bookkeeping with nightmares about finances
Online transcription with difficult noisy audio files.

The game starts with ¥1000, pocket tissues, and an apartment key in Susumu's inventory. Every turn represents one week, bringing Susumu closer to the 365-day deadline. XP is earned for good and bad choices, and Susumu's motivation to find a job increases with every 10 levels gained. At level 50, he has a good chance of finding a job. Winning the game means finding a job and leaving the hikikomori lifestyle behind.","Losing means facing the harsh reality of unemployment and poverty, which are the two most feared outcomes in this story.

Snar's one advantage lay in growing up as the offspring of a high-ranking officer, an inheritance that now stood him in good stead.

While he maintained the mental struggle, Snar leaped the gap between them and in two snips removed two of his foe's adjacent limbs. Any three legs were sufficient for walking, but not for battle. Snar's opponent retained the sense of mind to drop to the ground since his claws could still articulate for full defensive coverage, but the psychic shock of his sudden reversal of fortune heralded his end.

Snar completely shredded the other's will and sense of self. Exultant in the hormonal afterglow of such strenuous and overwhelming effort, Snar leisurely spent a period of time experimenting as he remotely manipulated and explored the absolute extent of his power over his new thrall. This amusement soon palled, so he sent a death pulse and the remaining legs sagged against the lifeless shell.

Snar scratched through the frozen surface to find a seep hole of the chemical slurry his kind used for nutrition. He knelt so that the semi-permeable membrane that surrounded his leg joints submerged enough for osmosis. He was extremely hungry from the stress of battle, as well as the recent molt. He stood up and hesitated, then returned to his defeated adversary and grabbed one of the dismembered limbs.

He placed it in the slurry, where, in time, it would generate a small Nuplar identical to the original. He could have regenerated clones from all five joints, but did not think such a quick defeat deserved propagation. He only saved the one because this was a cousin of his bloodline. The grandparent would retrieve the new child at the end of the games, locating it by the resonating signature since the donor had regenerated from one of his own legs in some previous battle.

"The Life of an Adjunct What to do next, as an Adjunct?  I was informed yesterday, with 6 days until the beginning of instruction, that 3 of the 4 courses I was supposed to teach were either cancelled or moved to a more senior teacher (because his class was cancelled).  Further, I am informed that gets to choose which of my classes he is taking, so I won't even know which one to get ready for until he makes his decision.  This complete disregard for class preparation, and interactions already had with the students, seems to be part of the downfall of Academia and the US.    And now I need to find a full time job as a new semester is already starting.

Your turn: I think you can still use the bones, but I'd like to suggest a few things to consider:
1. The bones will likely be quite tough and fibrous, so you may want to break them down a bit before using them in stock.
2. You may want to remove any excess fat or connective tissue from the bones to make them more usable.
3. The bones may contain some of the pork's natural collagen,","It was great. I'm just wondering what I can do with the bones. Thanks!
I would say yes, you could use them.

Stand Mixer - Are any of the affordable options worth it? With Christmas around the corner my sister's bf suggested gifting my sister a stand mixer since she does not have one.

"Data format:
You must have [R code] data type in the following Rewrite prompt
Rewrite prompt:
Can you help me create a program in R that can generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 and store them in a vector?
To generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 in R, you can use the sample() function. Here's the algorithm to generate the random integers and store them in a vector:
1. Declare a vector variable to store the random integers.
2. Generate the random integers using the sample() function.
3. Store the generated random integers in the vector.
4. Display the vector to verify that the integers are stored correctly.
Here's the R code to implement the above algorithm:
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducibility
rand_int <- sample(1:1000, 100, replace = TRUE) # generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 and store in a vector
print(rand_int) # display the vector of random integers
Can you explain how the set.seed() function works in R and why it's used in this code?","set.seed() is a function in R that sets the random number generator's seed. The seed is a starting point for the random number generator, which generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. If you set the seed to the same value before generating random numbers, you'll get the same sequence of random numbers every time.
In the above code, set.seed(123) sets the seed to 123. This means that every time you run the code","?
set.seed(123) is used to seed the random number generator in R. The seed value is used to reproduce the same sequence of random numbers in the future. This is useful in statistical analysis when you want to ensure that the results are consistent across different runs of the code.
For example, when you want to compare the results of a different experiment, you can set the seed value and run the experiment twice to get the same results. This is because the random number generator is seeded, so"

Explain why in the center of mass frame of reference frame for two moving particles they both have the same energy,". This question is related to the concept of the center of mass (COM) frame in classical mechanics, which is a reference frame where the total momentum of a system of particles is zero.

In the center of mass frame, we consider the system of two particles, let's call them particle 1 and particle 2, with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and velocities \(\vec{v}_1\) and \(\vec{v}_2",".
The center of mass (COM) frame is a reference frame in which the total kinetic energy is conserved. This means that the total kinetic energy of the system is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual particles. In the center of mass frame, the velocity of each particle is equal to the velocity of the center of mass.
In the center of mass frame, the two particles are moving together as a single particle. The total kinetic energy of the system is:

"In this task, you're given four sentences of a story written in natural language, and one last sentence (Sentence5). Your job is to classify whether the last sentence completes the rest of the story coherently or not by providing 'Yes' or 'No'.
Q: Sentence1: I was walking to the store recently. Sentence2: As I was passing an exit, I felt cold, hard steel on my arm. Sentence3: I was shocked that I was being hit by a car! Sentence4: The driver was very apologetic after he saw I was hit. 
 Sentence5: The driver of the car became very angry at me.
A: ","Based on the story, the last sentence does not complete the story coherently. The story has been written in a way where the driver was apologetic after the incident, but the last sentence contradicts this by stating that the driver became angry. So, the answer is 'No'.

"How can I make cookie dough that won't bake when heated? I know this sounds like a weird question - hear me out!   I recently made this cookie dough cake. I really love the idea of a cookie dough cake and I thought that the icing and cookie dough bits were *on point*. However, the sponge of the cake is really dense and flavorless.

"I've heard that farming allowed for complex civilisation to develop because it gave a food surplus, giving some people time to engage in other crafts, but I've ALSO heard that hunter-gatherers had more free time than farmers - surely this means hunter-gatherers could have done the same?

Does continental shift have any effect on man made structures like bridges and canals that connect them? i.e. a bridge between Africa and Europe and Panama Canal?,"I've always wondered if the continental drift has any effect on man-made structures.

### Reply:Continental drift, the gradual movement of Earth's continents over geological time, does indeed have the potential to affect man-made structures like bridges and canals, albeit over very long periods. The primary concern with such structures is their design and the materials used, which must accommodate the forces and movements of the Earth","?
The continental drift theory suggests that continents have moved over time. These movements have resulted in changes to the earth’s surface, including the formation of mountain ranges, the creation of ocean basins, and the shifting of coastlines. One of the key effects of these movements is the creation of new oceanic crust and the formation of new landmasses.

## Step 1: Understanding Continental Drift and Its Effects
Continental drift is the movement of the Earth's continents relative to each other."

I'm in the middle of making chicken stock for a wonton soup I'd like to have tonight, but am wondering why on earth one skims things.

"CMV: Resisting arrest should not be allowed as the solo criminal charge In March of this year, police officers in Sacramento arrested a man they misidentified as having a warrant out for his arrest. The arrest turned physical with an officer kicking the suspect while he was being compliant.

Just earlier today, a disturbing video was made public that showed an officer from the Anderson Police using a recently banned ""chokehold restraint"" to arrest a man that was only eventually charged with resisting arrest.   Using this as a sole charge is often the byproduct of a police mistake or even an unjustified arrest.

"Read this for context:
Roxana is a shareholder because Roxana wants to have a say in the company's direction. As a shareholder, Roxana is able to vote on corporate decisions and elect the board of directors. Having a say in the company's direction ensures that Roxana's interests are represented at the highest level of decision-making.

Roxana: Hey, thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I know we're both busy, but I wanted to talk to you about something important.
CEO: Of course, what's on your mind?
Roxana: I'm a shareholder in the company, and I'm concerned about the direction it's going in. Specifically, I'm worried about the level of risk the company is taking on.
CEO: Understandable. Can you give me some examples of what you're referring to?
Roxana: Well, for starters, I noticed that we've been investing a lot in new product development recently. And while I think it's important to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, I worry that we might be biting off more than we can chew financially. We could end up overstretched and end up losing money instead of making it.
CEO: Hmm...I see your point. But let me ask you this - why do you think shareholders should be worried about this? After all, isn't it our job as management to make decisions that are in the best interests of the company? And if we believe that investing in new products is the best way to grow the business and generate returns for shareholders, then isn't that what we should do?
Roxana: Well...I guess my concern is that shareholders could end up footing the bill if things go wrong with these new products. For example, if we invest a lot of money into developing a new product and it ends up being a flop, shareholders could lose a lot of money. And even if the product is successful but only marginally so, shareholders may not see much return on their investment either. So there's definitely potential downside here from a shareholder perspective.

"Ethics of Leaving a Job Very Early-On I am an electrical engineer that just recently graduated with my BS with a focus in industrial controls and automation. I took a position with a fairly large consulting company before the pandemic began back in December. My start date was then pushed from May to August because of the virus and a lack of work. However now that I have started I am becoming increasingly frustrated as I am being given very little guidance, receiving little to no communication (currently working from home), and very little meaningful work. I am becoming increasingly unsure about wether or not a company that treats a new hire in this way, even during this pandemic, is one that I want to be working for.   While sitting at my desk with literally nothing to do I began browsing LinkedIn and came across a very intriguing job opening from another company with whom I had a chance to work with on a project during a Co-op in school. I really want to apply but am worried that jumping ship at my current company is not ethical since I have only been there about a month. Has anyone been in a similar situation or how should I approach this situation?","I know it will be difficult for me to leave my current job because I am not in a financial position where I can easily start over, but I am beginning to feel like my mental health is being compromised by this situation.

"How can you deny the existence of qualia? The existence of qualia seems like the most certain thing in the world. Even if the laptop I am seeing right now did not actually exist, it is nonetheless true that it seems to me, phenomenally, that there is a laptop in front of me. Even if solipsism were true, I myself would have qualia; it is just that no one else would.  But, if I am right, there are theories of mind such as behaviourism and eliminative materialism which deny the existence of qualia altogether.

I don't think I've ever met anyone who was willing to deny the existence of qualia. However, I don't see how denying the existence of qualia can be sensible.

"In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., ""sympathetic"" and ""stern"") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.
Example: Context word: upset.
Example solution: Sentence 1: PersonX yelled at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news. 
Sentence 2: PersonX comforted at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news.
Example explanation: As expected, two sentences contain mentions of PersonX and PersonY and they're quite similar. Their difference is in terms of trigger words (""yelled"" and ""comforted""), whcih result in them having different answers. As required by the instructions, the answer to sentence 1 and sentence 2 are PersonX and PersonY, respectively.

Problem: Context Word: abused horse.
","Solution: Sentence 1: PersonX kept the abused horse _ safe in the stable. 
Sentence 2: PersonY helped PersonX to handle the abused horse.

Explanation: Sentence 1 contains PersonX, who is the one handling the horse. Sentence 2 contains PersonY, who is helping PersonX. The contrast between handling and being abused results in different answers for the two sentences. PersonX and PersonY are used only once and PersonX appears earlier in each sentence.

"For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Cherelle: That's great! It sounds like you're really in love with her. Marriage is a huge commitment though, so you need to make sure that you're absolutely sure before taking that step. Are you sure that she feels the same way about you?
Lynzee: Yeah, I am pretty confident that she does feel the same way about me since she has hinted at marriage before too. Plus, we just generally have a great time together and get along really well so I think that bodes well for our future together.
Cherelle: Okay, well those are all good points. If you're both on the same page then marriage could definitely be a possibility for the two of you down the road. Just make sure that you're both 100% certain before making any decisions though!
Lynzee: Yeah, definitely. I just wanted to talk to you about it first because your opinion matters a lot to me. But I think this is something that I really want to do and I'm pretty confident that Sarah feels the same way too.
Cherelle: Well then, congratulations! If you're both sure about this then I think marriage could be a great step for the two of you. Just remember to take things slow and be absolutely certain before making any decisions. Wishing you all the best in your future together!

"[LOTR] Why was Frodo corrupted by the Ring? It's largely regarded that Frodo technically failed in his question to destroy the ring, for he would, if not for the intervention of Golum, put the ring on and did the same thing as Isildur. Obviously the ring itself is constantly trying to manipulate the wearer, and likely tried to goad their desires or interests for this.

Can air conditioning gas or another gas be used to absorb heat to increase its pressure and then run a turbine or cylinder to generate electricity,"?
Yes, it is possible to use air conditioning gases as an energy source. These gases can be used to absorb heat, increase pressure, and then run a turbine to generate electricity. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:
1. Heat is absorbed from a heat source, such as a steam turbine or a heat exchanger.
2. The absorbed heat is transferred to the gas, causing it to expand and increase its pressure.
3. The expanding gas is then used to drive a turbine","?


# Answer

The concept you're referring to is similar to the principles behind combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants, but with a twist involving air conditioning (AC) refrigerant. In traditional power generation, the Rankine cycle is used in conjunction with a Brayton cycle (or a similar gas turbine cycle) to generate electricity. The Rankine cycle involves heating water to produce steam, which then drives a"

"As part of the course you’ll take on 3 modules – Human Structure and Function (HSF), World of Microorganisms (WOM) and Molecular Basis of Life (MBL).
WOM and MBL are part of the School of Biological Sciences – in these modules you’ll be seated alongside Biologists, Zoologists, Medicinal Chemists and many others. These are also the bigger modules with 300 in each!
These modules have lectures on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In addition to this you’ll also sit a 3 hour lab once a week.
HSF happens on Tuesday and Thursday (so yes… you’ll be in everyday of the week). The class is a lot smaller – 115 people. The content here is pretty varied and you’ll have a mixture of lectures, practicals (anatomy and physiology) and tutorials.
As a whole the lecturers are very accessible. You can easily contact them by their email – either to get an answer to your question or arrange to meet with them if you’re have particular difficulty with something. You can just as easily approach them at the end of the lecture.
You are expected to work outside the lecture hours but how much or how little you do is up to you. They give you estimates for how long you should spend (we were told at the start we should expect 9-5 days) but work it into a schedule that suits you. I know from experience that going over a lecture can take me from 1 to 3 hours!
Almost all lecturers will also provide you with additional reading to go alongside the lecture – it’s great for learning more about a topic… especially if it’s an area you are specifically interested in.
All practicals are timetabled and are carried out in one of Queen's many labs. You’ll learn many techniques that are used in professional laboratories. They also give you the opportunity to visualise what you have been learning in lectures.
Tutorials are part of the HSF module. They provide an opportunity to apply what you have been learning in lectures to real life situations. I definitely find them challenging as sometimes the answer isn’t always clear so they’re a great opportunity to ask questions too.
They’re also great for interacting with the lecturer who’ll be able to guide the direction of your thoughts to help you answer the question.
Throughout the year you will sit a number of assessments across all three modules. The marks from the assessments are included in your final module mark. Assessments can take very different forms – computer multiple choice, written or group work!
In the case of WOM and MBL weekly labs also make up part of your final mark. At the end of the year you each module requires you to sit a written exam.
Once you’ve got through all this you’re more than ready for the weekend to come!
Find out more about studying Human Biology or Biomedical Science at Queen's.

The funeral for one of the victims of a car crash near Calne, described as a ""ray of sunshine"" by his family, will be held this week.

The crash on the A4 in Derry Hill at around 3am on August 16, in which a car crashed into a house and caught fire, resulted in the deaths of Ryan Nelson, 20, Corey Owen, 19, Matthew Parke, 19, and Jordan Rawlings, 20.

The funeral of Ryan Nelson will be held on Friday afternoon (September 18), with the cortege to drive through the Wiltshire town to allow mourners to pay their respects.

Family tributes to Ryan described him as a ""ray of sunshine"" who was ""loved by everyone"".

The moving tribute said: ""Ryan, our ray of sunshine. He lightened up everyone's life, a truly wonderful gentleman, so polite with lovely morals.

""Ryan worked in Tesco. He loved it there as he was with his friends. He was a massive football fan. He supported Aldershot Town FC and Manchester United. He was a very talented DJ, it was something he wished to pursue in the future.

""Ryan was loved by everyone. He has the most beautiful soul. So handsome, he loved all his designer gear, had so much pride. Our lives are empty without him.""

Floral tributes to all four victims were left by the side of the A4 in the aftermath of the crash as the local community honoured them.

The funeral procession will pass by Calne Town Hall at 2pm and will then proceed towards the Tesco store where Ryan worked.

There will be a celebration of Ryan's life after the service, but this is by invitation only to ensure it can be held safely at a Covid-secure venue.

The details of funerals of the other victims have not been disclosed at this time.

Anyone wanting to pay respects to the victims has been warned by police that they need to do so in line with social distancing rules and the newly-introduced 'rule of six' when lining the streets.

Inspector James Brain, from the Chippenham Area Community Policing Team, said the police and the local authority had been working closely with the family to allow them to celebrate Ryan's life in as safe a way as possible.

He said: ""We completely understand that those who knew and loved Ryan want to be able to come together to remember him and pay their last respects.

""However, his family have made it clear that they want to be able to do this in a safe way, which does not pose a risk to public health.

""The town will see four funerals over the coming weeks, and I know this period of mourning will be very difficult for those having to say goodbye to much-loved sons, brothers and friends.

""However, the last thing anyone wants is for this to lead to an outbreak of Covid-19 in the town, so I would urge everyone - particularly young people in Calne - to be mindful of social distancing and the current Government restrictions.""

Wiltshire Council has also reminded mourners of the need to pay their respects safely, while recognising this was a ""devastating time"" for all involved.

Terence Herbert, chief executive of Wiltshire Council, said: ""This is a devastating time for those involved and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the four young men who lost their lives in this tragic accident.

""Understandably the family and friends of Corey, Jordan, Matthew, and Ryan want to celebrate their lives. We are working closely with colleagues at the police to support them to do so safely and within the latest Government legislation.

""These are unprecedented times and we understand this is difficult for those grieving loved ones.""
