Magnetotactic bacteria from Pavilion Lake, British Columbia
Introduction
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) have been found in a variety of aquatic sediments such as marine environments, freshwater lakes and rivers, hot springs, and brackish waters all over the world . In these settings, MTB tend to reside in chemically stratified water or sediment at the oxic-anoxic interface. The common feature that is unique to all MTB is their ability to synthesize intracellular membrane-bound crystals of single domain magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4) . The magnetosomes provide a torque on the cells that passively aligns them with the Earth's geomagnetic field. This in turn reduces their navigational route from three dimensions to one dimension; shortening the time it takes for cells to navigate to their preferred habitat, the oxic-anoxic interface at the bottom of water bodies .

Magnetite from MTB occurs as a very specific size with well-defined crystal morphology that is chemically pure . Such minerals are preserved in the rock record as “magnetofossils,” which have been found in Mesozoic rocks, and may extend back as far as the pre-Cambrian . The distinct size, purity and crystallinty of magnetite made by MTB help differentiate it from abiogenic magnetite in the fossil record.

This study investigates uncultured MTB from Pavilion Lake, a deep, slightly alkaline, freshwater lake in British Columbia. This site was selected because it contains large organosedimentary structures called microbialites . Such structures abound in the fossil record back to nearly 3.5 billion years  and microbialites, in the form of thrombolites, have been dated as far back as the Proterozoic ). The MTB that we isolated from Pavilion Lake belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of the cells, and the size and shape of magnetosomes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of the magnetosomes. This is the first time MTB have been described from a microbialite-forming environment. This discovery could be of great value to others interested in potential life forms on other planets or the earliest forms of life on Earth as Pavilion Lake contains microbial fossils in the freshwater microbialites.

- Use high-quality rice.
- Use a cooking technique that concentrates the flavor of the rice, such as steaming or boiling.

Soccer-Liverpool's Jordan Henderson named England's Footballer of the Year

Liverpool's Premier League title winning captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers' Association (FWA).

(Adds details)

By Simon Evans

July 24 (Reuters) - Liverpool's Premier League title winning
captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the
Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers'
Association (FWA).

Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester United's
Marcus Rashford and Liverpool pair Virgil van Dijk and Sadio
Mane made up the rest of the top five.

The 30-year-old Henderson has been central to Liverpool's
success under Juergen Klopp through his leadership and tireless
midfield work.

""As grateful as I am I don't feel like I can accept this on
my own. I don't feel like anything I've achieved this season or
in fact during my whole career has been done on my own,"" said
Henderson.

""I owe a lot to so many different people – but none more so
than my current team mates – who have just been incredible and
deserve this every bit as much as I do,"" he said.

Henderson has played in 30 of Liverpool's league matches so
far this season and scored four goals.

Two other Liverpool players - right back Trent
Alexander-Arnold and goalkeeper Alisson Becker - also received
votes.

""I accept it on behalf of this whole squad, because without
them I'm not in a position to be receiving this honour. These
lads have made me a better player – a better leader and a better
person,"" added Henderson.

""If anything I hope those who voted for me did so partly to
recognise the entire team's contribution.""

The Footballer of the Year trophy has been awarded since
1948 when Stanley Matthews was its first recipient.

Why was it so hard to build the Panama Canal?,"The Panama Canal was one of the most ambitious engineering projects in history. It was a massive undertaking that took over 10 years to complete. Several factors contributed to the difficulty of building the canal:

* The Panama Isthmus is a narrow passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The narrowness of the canal made it difficult to build a canal with a wide enough width to accommodate ships and allow them to pass through.
* The Panama Isthmus is also a very shallow body of water","# Answer
The construction of the Panama Canal was an enormously challenging project due to several factors:

1. **Geography and Topography**: The Isthmus of Panama where the canal was built is a narrow strip of land with rugged terrain, including mountains and dense rainforests. The challenge of navigating and excavating through this difficult landscape was a major obstacle.

2. **Health Issues**: The tropical climate"

Why can lotus grow in the desert?,"Lotus is a plant that is native to Southeast Asia. It is not found in the desert, as it requires a lot of water to survive. However, there are a few ways that lotus can adapt to grow in the desert:

- **Transpiration:** Lotus has a waxy cuticle on its leaves, which helps to reduce water loss. This allows the plant to store water for later use.


- **Deep roots:** Lotus has deep roots that can reach into the groundwater. This helps","A: The lotus plant has adapted to survive in harsh conditions by growing roots in the muddy water at the bottom of the pond, where the water is cooler and more nutrient-rich.

Explain like I'm five years old Why can you jumpstart a car battery with the black cable on the negative pin on the battery or the car frame? Doesn’t the electricity flow negative to positive?,"Let me know if I should be worried about this.

Sure, here's a simplified explanation of why you can jumpstart a car battery with the black cable on the negative pin on the battery or the car frame:

* **Electricity flows differently than you might think.** Instead of flowing from positive to negative, electricity flows from negative to positive. This is because the black cable is connected to the negative terminal, which is always connected to the ground.
* **When you jumpstart","I understand that electricity flows from the positive to the negative terminal of a battery.

"CMV: Sanders and Warren will beat Biden if (and only if) one drops out and runs as the other's vp NOW Assuming that Sanders and Warren are both ideology-driven candidates, running for the primary purpose of furthering their (mostly overlapping) agenda, they should form a running coalition in which one drops out to run as the other's running mate, thus giving them a fighting chance at one of them getting the nomination.  The number of progressive voters isn't large enough to beat Biden if Sanders and Warren split the vote, but almost certainly is if it is coalesced.  Currently, RCP has the following poll averages:  Nationally: Biden: 32.2 Sanders: 16.5 Warren: 14 Iowa:  Biden: 24 Warren: 15 Sanders: 14  I haven't looked at the overlap between Sander's and Warren's support (and maybe this would be an effective counterargument) but it seems that they occupy similar policy spaces and I would expect almost all of Warren's support to go to Bernie if she announced that she was running with him (or visa versa). It would almost tie them with Biden immediately, which we would expect given that roughly half of democratic voters identify as liberal and half moderate.  Furthermore, bringing one of the two candidates into the spotlight would allow progressive voters, volunteers, donors, media AND support organizations to focus their attention and resources on one of them. It would also activate and engage disenfranchised progressive constituents who are feeling discouraged about the current chances of either progressive candidate winning the race.  NOTE: I only intend to argue this from a strategic perspective. Really not trying to get into a debate about whether we should WANT any candidate to win, nor discuss the merits of different agendas.","**Argument:**

- Sanders and Warren are both ideology-driven candidates who should form a running coalition to increase their chances of winning the nomination.
- If one of them drops out and runs as the other's running mate, it would give them a fighting chance at one of them getting the nomination.
- The number of progressive voters is not large enough to beat Biden if Sanders and Warren split the vote, but almost certainly is if it is coalesced.
- Bringing one of","The argument that the progressive agenda should be sacrificed for the sake of winning is a debate for another day.  As far as I can tell, the only reason someone would argue against this strategy would be that they think it's not in the best interest of the progressive agenda.

"Someone tripped on my dog at a dog-friendly establishment I took my dog to a dog-friendly restaurant and bar and had a single drink with a friend, and while we were there someone that was on their way out tripped over/stepped on my dog in a way that caused her to yelp. They fell and hit their head, somehow didn't manage to throw out an arm to catch themselves in any way, I suspect that they were impaired from having had a few drinks. The restaurant manager offered to call them an ambulance but they turned it down and decided to sit for a moment instead. Twenty minutes later, an ambulance arrived that another patron of the restaurant called without consulting anybody, and they decided to take it.

"[Meta] Signing off as a mod Normally mods come and go without much fanfair, but I thought I'd take a moment to explain why I'm leaving as a mod and most likely the sub.  I've been part of this community for about 7 years now and watched it grow bigger. There have been some changes - some popular and some less so. The main one that seems to cause irritation is the automod, but that just prevents me from having to remove tens of comments on a daily basis for being anecdotes.   This is also an issue we get a lot of abuse over. Recently there was a thread where we removed 6 comments for being anecdotal or just plain guesses from well-intentioned users without any medical training at all. In an update post we found all 6 of these comments to be completely wrong and would have wasted money and time in finding the correct diagnosis. So yes, there is harm in these guesses and we remove them. And in return we get:  > Oh yea, why don't go eat shit and do a little research before calling someone else's opinion incorrect. And then go fuck yourself. Retard. Now go ahead and ban me because you are wrong like homeless bum.  Or   >I'm sorry but didnt it not address the concern? Your rules fucking Suck jam it up your ass.

"CMV: Democrat Leaders Extending the Patriot Act Shows Their Animosity Towards Trump is Mostly Rhetoric Of course, most people are aware of the impeachment hearings against Trump. However, just yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to fund and extend the Patriot Act for an extended 3 months after December 20th.   It seems to me hypocritical to believe that Trump is unfit for office and abused his power and then proceeds to potentially give him more power--or at least extending the duration of his current powers.   Additionally, Representative Justin Amash attempted to amend the budget bill by removing the Patriot Act language but the amendment was blocked by the Democrats on the Rules Committee. Only 10 Democrats voted against the resolution, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Tlaib.   The Trump administration still retains authority to reinitiate the NSA call records program, the program where millions of innocent American calls had been collected, if they deem it necessary.   Given the fact that the Trump administration could potentially extend another 4 years, it seems questionable at best why Democrats would not strip him of some of the powers he could abuse when they had the opportunity to. Given this, it seems to me most of the rhetoric against Trump is just for show. When presented with something to act on, most of the Democrats chose to empower Trump, and allow his administration the power to listen and collect calls, information, and data on millions of Americans.",,"It is not a coincidence that the House of Representatives voted to fund and extend the Patriot Act, and that the Democrats would not strip him of power when it was presented to them.

"How NOT to Sell Myself Short with Salary I work as an RF Designer at a defense company in Los Angeles.  I've been fortunate enough to secure an interview with a tech company in the Bay Area (Cupertino). I've always wanted to work in tech so this is a great opportunity.  I currently make $102K with ~3.5 YOE.  The topic of compensation might come up and I want to be prepared just in case, but I honestly have no idea how to approach this for a couple of reasons:  1. It's a big CoL adjustment and I'm not sure how to accurately translate my salary. I've looked at two calculators for the area where I'd be working. One says $170K and another says $240K. I guess I could average these...? This just seems sooo high.   I've looked on a couple salary websites trying to compare against similar roles and experience levels. I think levels.fyi is probably the most accurate.  The salaries are submitted anonymously and they verify them with offer letters, W2s, etc. When I narrow it down to hardware positions at this company I'm seeing salaries that range from $135K to 200K+.  2. RF is very niche and I feel like the market for it is on fire right now. I get bombarded with messages/calls almost daily asking if I'd be willing to discuss a potential job opportunity. I also have two things in my favor: the job I'm applying for has been listed for a few months and I'm currently employed. This feels like a good place to negotiate from.  3. This one is more psychological and something I just need to get over. If compensation does come up its going to feel weird discussing a salary thats A LOT higher than what I currently make. It feels like I'd be negotiating for more Monopoly money. I already undervalue myself and I don't want to move jobs and cities to essentially take a paycut.  My fear is that I'll lowball my salary expectation because I have my current salary and CoL as a frame of reference.   Can anyone who has gone through a similar situation impart some wisdom for me here?  And...it's totally possible, hell even likely, I don't get an offer and this post is moot. I still appreciate the information because this probably won't be the last time I'm confronted with a situation like this. I just like to be prepared.","A: As others have said, don't.  You'll be in a better position if you don't bring up the topic in the first place.  If they ask, you can say ""I'm not comfortable discussing compensation until I have an offer.""

KIID (1470 AM) is a radio station licensed to Sacramento, California, United States. The station is owned by Punjabi American Media LLC.

It is simulcast with 1450 AM KOBO (Yuba City), KWRU 1300 AM (Fresno) and KLHC 1350 AM (Bakersfield).

History

KXOA
Lincoln Dellar put KXOA on the air in 1945 at 1490 kHz, alongside an FM outlet at 107.9 MHz. KXOA, Sacramento's fourth radio station, broadcast with 250 watts and was an affiliate of the Don Lee Network and Mutual Broadcasting System. Dellar sold the station in 1946 to Sacramento Broadcasters; the new owners were approved to relocate the station to 1470 kHz with 1,000 watts in 1948. Cal-Val Radio acquired KXOA in 1958 and increased the station's power to 5,000 watts during the day in 1960.

In the late 1950s, KXOA switched to a Top 40 format, fiercely competing with KROY (1240 AM) once that station flipped to the format in 1960. A young Don Imus was hired away from Stockton station KJOY in 1970 to do morning drive; he quickly left for Cleveland's WGAR. In May 1970, KXOA changed its format to a blend of Adult Contemporary and Oldies, with the slogan of ""Let the Sound Shine In.""  KXOA-AM-FM were sold to separate owners at the end of 1970, and while the FM station kept the call letters, the AM station, sold to Mediacast, Inc., had to change and became KNDE, changing its format to progressive rock. 1470 AM was sold back to KXOA-FM, Inc., in 1978, and regained its KXOA call letters as a result. By 1980, KXOA had moved to oldies as ""14K"", and in 1982, it began broadcasting the Music of Your Life syndicated format. The station changed to business news in 1988 and then returned to oldies in 1990 as ""Cruisin 1470"".

Changes and sale to Radio Disney
On April 15, 1997, the callsign was changed to KQPT; on July 16, 1998 to KOME; on January 15, 1999 to KRAK; and finally on February 19, 2001 to the current KIID, along with the sale to The Walt Disney Company and switch to the Radio Disney format (after a period of simulcasting then-sister KNCI that began on October 16, 2000).

On July 15, 2009, two of the three radio towers KIID broadcasts from were destroyed due to a fire at the transmitter site. Towers 1 (center) and 2 (eastern) were destroyed. All three towers were replaced by towers of shorter height. This replacement allowed the licensee to petition for eliminating the requirement for painting and lighting the towers.

Sale to Punjabi American Media
On August 13, 2014, Disney put KIID and twenty-two other Radio Disney stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. Disney originally planned to temporarily shut down the station on September 26, 2014. However, will remain on the air and continue carrying Radio Disney programming until it is sold.

On June 29, 2015, Radio Disney Sacramento filed an application to sell KIID to Punjabi American Media. It was approved by the FCC on August 26, 2015. The sale was completed on September 25, 2015, at a purchase price of $800,000.

Last month, an op–ed in The New York Times argued that high-protein and high-fat diets are to blame for America’s ever-growing waistline and incidence of chronic disease. The author, Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute, is no newcomer to these nutrition debates. For 37 years he has been touting the benefits of very low-fat, high-carbohydrate, vegetarian diets for preventing and reversing heart disease. But the research he cites to back up his op–ed claims is tenuous at best. Nutrition is complex but there is little evidence our country’s worsening metabolic ills are the fault of protein or fat. If anything, our attempts to eat less fat in recent decades have made things worse.

Ornish begins his piece with a misleading statistic. Despite being told to eat less fat, he says, Americans have been doing the opposite: They have “actually consumed 67 percent more added fat, 39 percent more sugar and 41 percent more meat in 2000 than they had in 1950 and 24.5 percent more calories than they had in 1970.” Yes, Americans have been eating more fat, sugar and meat, but we have also been eating more vegetables and fruits (pdf)—because we have been eating more of everything.

What’s more relevant to the discussion is this fact: During the time in which the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. nearly tripled, the percentage of calories Americans consumed from protein and fat actually dropped whereas the percentage of calories Americans ingested from carbohydrates—one of the nutrient groups Ornish says we should eat more of—increased. Could it be that our attempts to reduce fat have in fact been part of the problem? Some scientists think so. “I believe the low-fat message promoted the obesity epidemic,” says Lyn Steffen, a nutritional epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. That’s in part because when we cut out fat, we began eating foods that were worse for us.

She personally knows the receptionist that works there through her ex boyfriends mutual friends.  8 years ago my sister had an abortion that was referred through the doctors office.   Recently she went to a get together and saw her ex boyfriends brother, who is a mutual friend of the receptionist. He told my sister that the receptionist disclosed her abortion to him because she knew the father was his brothers and she thought he should know.   Can my sister still file a HIPAA violation? My sister still goes to this office and the receptionist still works there. She has already spoken to the doctor’s office and they said that they would hold a meeting on hipaa rights but theyre claiming that there isn’t much more they can do.","### Response:

She's still hung up on her ex, and you don't do relationships. You clear?""

With his laughing mood snuffed suddenly, Max ground his teeth for a moment. He glanced up at Patricia, who'd been listening to the one-sided conversation the whole time and seemed to be watching him closely now.

""Crystal,"" he said as his and Patricia's eyes locked.

""Good. Eat your pizza and get your ass out of there, before you do something I can guarantee you'll regret.""

As soon as he hung up, Patricia hit him up. ""So, what was he making sure you were _crystal_ clear about?""

Surprised by this, Max peered at her, wondering if maybe the volume on his phone was too loud and she'd heard Moe. But she shrugged. ""Unless you were talking about a girl named Crystal, typically the one-word response would be because someone was asking if you were clear about something?""

""Is that right? Wow."" Max smiled at her. ""That's _exactly_ what he asked.""

Patricia smiled. ""Don't look so impressed, Max. Like _My Cousin Vinny_ there are several courthouse dramas in particular I've seen often, and _A Few Good Men_ just so happens to be one of the most quoted movies of all time. Not the part where Colonel Jessep demands certainty that Kaffee is clear about his pompous rant. But I've seen the movie enough times that it's the first thing that comes to mind when I hear someone ask or say they're _crystal_ clear. Anyway, it was pretty obvious just from hearing your end of that conversation. Was he making sure you're clear about not getting any ideas again?""

""Yeah."" Max nodded, keeping to himself how sure Moe sounded when he said she's still hung up on her ex. ""Guess he's worried I might do something stupid that Izzy would be upset about. But we both know that's out of the question . . . _right_?""

""It is. I'm surprised he doesn't see how _impossible_ it would be for anything between you and me to ever work."" Before he could ask her to elaborate, she was saved by the damn bell, the doorbell that is.

What is the probability of a stable subatomic particle undergoing spontaneous decay?,"The question is about spontaneous decay in general, not a specific particle or decay mode.

Sure, here's a breakdown of the concept:

* **Spontaneous decay:** A process in which a subatomic particle spontaneously breaks apart, resulting in the release of energy or particles.
* **Stable subatomic particle:** A subatomic particle that remains unchanged in its quantum state during the decay process.

The question asks about the probability of a **stable subatomic particle** undergoing spontaneous decay","Solution:
To answer this question, we need to understand what a stable subatomic particle is and what spontaneous decay means. In the context of particle physics, a stable subatomic particle is one that does not decay into other particles over time. These particles have a very long lifetime and can exist for extended periods without changing.

Spontaneous decay, on the other hand, is a process in which an unstable subatomic particle transforms into other particles without any"

"CMV: It's unfair to hire employees who only speak a language the vast majority of the employees/customers do not speak I live in America, and I work at a hotel. There's a large population of Spanish-speakers in my area, but most of them speak Spanish *and* English.  At my job, though, I have at least three coworkers who speak pretty much no English. It's frustrating trying to communicate with them sometimes, and this is even though I do know how to say some things in Spanish, and that I'm willing to look things  up on a translator site before talking to them if I need to. But if it wasn't for those things, I'd never be able to talk to them without a bilingual coworker to translate.  My general manager speaks no Spanish, so any time he needs to talk one-on-one with them, he has to have someone translate, which, among other things, presents a privacy issue.

During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 15 and 16, 1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, ""I really like the sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't get a chance to see the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well.""

"Help with Underperforming Intern I have several years experience dealing with summer interns and thought I was pretty good at it. I pride myself at running an internship program that is both paid and adheres to the ""no coffee/no copies"" policy (e.g., provides useful job training and acquisition of skills that can be used going forward).  I've hired a few interns at the company and helped many more find the right job for them in the field.  &#x200B;  Until this summer.  Of the four interns, three are amazing.  The last one, however, is struggling.  He cannot work at all independently, is sloppy, and doesn't follow basic workplace rules. I started off managing him the way that I managed others, but he produced work riddled with mistakes and never asked questions, even when given multiple opportunities to clarify.  He has twice called out last minute (and two additional times not shown up at all), frequently comes in 90+ minutes late, and almost always leaves 30 minutes early and takes lunches longer than an hour.  I have changed my management style with him as much as possible (twice/day meetings, double checking all his work at multiple stages of the process, and refusing to approve his time card until he amends it to reflect the actual hours he worked, not the 9-5 he claims).  I have also spoken with him about proper attendance, proper use of a shared office (he decorated every available wall and table space and doesn't really understand he is sharing an office with other people who might want to use it), and about proper email communication.  &#x200B;  Two weeks ago, after adding up my time dealing with him (and the direct consequences of him flaking, angering others or producing sub--par work), I realized that I spent \~20 hours of my time. The work product he produced is probably less than two hours of what I could do with these tasks, so I was out 18 hours (and had to work the weekend to get my job done). Last week, after he arrived two hours late (he missed our scheduled 9:15 meeting and I was currently in another meeting), the office manager put him to work scanning old files for digital record keeping. With some supervision from her, he was able to do a pretty decent job.  We decided that he would try this for a week, and it turned out that he was able to scan with only 1 or 2 errors.  &#x200B;  I planned to use this for the rest of the summer, but as soon as he walked in the door Monday (around 10:45), he was in my office complaining how the other interns get better projects.  He said he didn't like the first projects he was assigned and accused me of unfair treatment.  I indicated that I had to revise the tasks because of all the problems that happened in the first few weeks. He then threatened to get his university internship office involved as I wasn't providing job skill development. He didn't show up today and both members of our HR department are on vacation. My boss suggested firing him, but I am unsure whether that is even possible with this internship. As things stand, it has made trouble for other employees, other interns, and is keeping me from getting my work done.  &#x200B;  I have paperwork. I have written documentation for things when I have noticed them (Call-outs, ghosting, coming in really late, and written records of some of the unusable products he submitted). I know one of our interns complained to HR about shared spaces, and I think one employee also complained because he was constantly bothering her instead of doing any work.

Obviously this is something that is discipline dependent (I'm interested in developmental and cognitive psychology) but I'm sure there's probably other people from different disciplines who are curious about this too. Also if you are still a PhD student, how many publications have you produced so far and how far into your program are you?","I'm also curious about what format the papers are in (e.g., journal articles, conference proceedings, etc.).

Thank you for your time and any insights you can provide.","I'm curious about this because I've read that a lot of PhD programs expect you to publish 2-4 papers, which I assume means during your PhD program.  I know this question is a little bit off topic and not strictly related to research (which I understand), but it would be really helpful if someone could answer this for me. I'm just curious.

Standing, stagnant water allways looks so disgusting.  Was the ones who lived immune systems so much better or were they able to keep the cistern free of diseases using plants or something?","A: In the past, cisterns would be cleaned out regularly (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) to remove any sediment and debris that could cause a buildup of bacteria.

"According to Nietzsche socialism is a ""residue"" of christianity, what does he meant and is it true? Nietzsche talked about socialism as a later development of christianity. Did he mean that there is an actual ""genealogical"" filliation between Christianism and Socialism? Or did he mean that both ""doctrines"" promoted similar values without one being the descendant from the other?  And what can modern philosophers say of this assertion? Was Nietzsche right to think that?  Thank you in advance for your answers!","Sure, here are the answers to your questions:

**1. What Nietzsche meant by the term ""residue"" of Christianity:**

Nietzsche used the term ""residue"" to refer to how certain elements of one culture or religion continue to influence another, even when the two cultures have been separated by time or distance. He believed that socialism could be seen as a ""residue"" of Christianity, as it shared many of the same values and principles with the Christian faith.

**2. Is","A: First, I'll try to give you a summary of his argument. Nietzsche thought that socialism is a ""residue"" of Christianity. What he meant was that the values of Christianity are inverted in socialism. For instance, Christianity values the individual as an inherently sinful creature in need of salvation. In socialism, the individual is seen as a ""victim"" of capitalism, who needs to be saved"

"Read this for context:
""The body is whole and it is here. Yes, of course I can."" She studied Ma Bichette's face and frowned.

""What? What's wrong?"" I asked, afraid that there was something wrong. I mean, other than the obvious.

""I can still do it,"" she said. ""Follow me.""

I followed her for what must have been hours. Never once did her feet leave dry ground, she expertly knew her way through the winding swamp. I said nothing. My arms were beginning to ache from carrying her for so long. Finally, we reached our destination.

A stone house. It was not what I was expecting. I am not sure what it was I was expecting. A ruined wooden shack, perhaps, or something even more archaic, like a thatched roof earthen hut. But it was a neatly built small house of rounded stones. I followed her into the house. Boxes and baskets and bottles filled dozen of shelves and tabletops. The sorceress pointed to a conspicuously empty table. ""Here.""

I carefully laid Ma Bichette on it.

The sorceress came up from behind me with a fine crystal glass. In it was an amber liquid which to this day I have never tasted the likes of. ""You look like you could use a drink,"" she said. I obediently drank it. It was both fiery and sweet and I could feel it slide down my throat as the sorceress rummaged about in a chest at the end of the table that Ma Bichette was lying on.

I leaned against the wall. ""Do you have a name?""

""Why wouldn't I?""

_Well, because you're a witch,_ I thought.

She laughed from across the room. ""Witches have names too. Alava, you can call me, if you want to call me something other than witch.""

Having my mind read like a book would have bothered me before but now it was comforting. At least she was a real witch.

Alava opened up a small leather bag and pulled out a handful of worn and polished bones. They looked like human finger bones. Again, had Ma Bichette's corpse not been lying before me I would have been worried. Alava tossed the bones on the table next to her, examined the bones, and then repeated the action twice more.

""There has been a misfortune,"" she said and turned to me.

I hadn't eaten since lunch and my head was swirling with my particular madness and whatever liquor Alava had given me. ""I know. She's dead.""

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.  The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.  Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.  Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.  He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further).   I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?  I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.  I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.  Do I need to take this seriously, or can I start coming up with more ways to say pound sand? What should I do if he does try to take further action?","**Response:**

It is important to take this matter seriously and seek legal counsel. A landlord cannot discriminate against a tenant based on sexual orientation and cannot impose fines or evictions based on statutory laws that criminalize consensual sexual activity between adults.

Momemtum growing for dementia-friendly Arran

A bid to make Arran Scotland's first-dementia friendly island has taken the first steps towards becoming a reality, with a second big push being held next week.

The idea was first reported by the Banner in May after being raised by Councillor Jimmy Miller, the older people's champion for North Ayrshire Council.

In order to take the matter forward a meeting was held at the Ormidale Pavilion in Brodick last month, when Donna Paterson, the local Alzheimer Scotland coordinator, was invited to provide more information and met with 18 interested people from a variety of backgrounds. The strong feeling of the meeting was that the time was right to try to establish Dementia Friendly Arran.

The group will meet again on Tuesday August 21 at 11.30am at the Ormidale Pavilion with the aim of creating a steering group who will take the work forward. The group would be keen to have the involvement of anyone interested and in particular representation from those caring for someone living with dementia.

Colin Adams, the social services team manager for Arran said: 'Given the demographic of Arran and the number of people on the island that are affected, considering ways in which people living with dementia could be supported is something that our Health and Social Care Partnership along various volunteer groups have been working on for some time.

'However, encouraging, informing and involving the whole community to be more mindful and participative in making the lives of our residents and visitors who are living with dementia that bit easier would obviously make a greater impact and has got to be a goal worth pursuing.'

The concept of a dementia-friendly community is not new – as far back as 2001, Alzheimer Scotland's Dementia Awareness Week focused on how to reduce stigma, raise awareness and create more dementia-friendly communities. But it's probably fair to say that the dementia-friendly movement was given a huge boost in March 2012 by the Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia south of the border. The attention this achieved gave an added impetus to some of the work which had been going on quietly for many years, with more and more communities coming forward to say they too wanted to get involved.

Alzheimer Scotland has been working to encourage the creation of dementia friendly communities across the country to achieve just that. On their website they describe how this works: 'A dementia friendly community is made up of the whole community – shop assistants, public service workers, faith groups, businesses, police, fire and ambulance staff, bus drivers, school pupils, clubs and societies, and community leaders – people who are committed to working together and helping people with dementia to remain a part of their community and not become apart from it.

'This involves learning a little about dementia and doing very simple and practical things that can make an enormous difference to people living with the condition.'

If you would like more information please call Collin Adams at the Lamlash council offices 01770 600742 or come along on day.

"I don’t know how to treat this pic I’m 18 years old male, and in the U.S. Navy. I went to medical to get a mole checked out, since it was being weird. It started feeling like a scab, and got a little bigger. Well, let’s just say that medical in the navy, or at least on my base, isn’t amazing. They said it showed all of the signs of being cancerous, but they couldn’t be sure so they wanted to send a sample in to a lab to get it verified. So the procedure they did was numb the area, put iodine on it, and take a razor blade and slice off the top layer of skin where the mole was, and then put silver nitrate in the wound. They cut pretty deep, and took quite a bit of skin. They gave me no bandages or anything, just said to apply Vaseline and a bandaid once or twice a day. That was yesterday morning. Since then it’s turned a weird grayish brown, and hasn’t stopped stinging. The surrounding area is stained from the iodine, that’s why it’s brown. It hurts all the way down to my wrist. I have no idea if it will heal, or if this silver nitrate is still in there and needs to be washed out or something, and it’s becoming very concerning to me. Any advice is much appreciated.","Hey there, it sounds like you had a procedure done on your mole, and you're experiencing some discomfort and concerns about the healing process.

"Mystery sweet chunky food from WW2? Sweet crunchy chunks mystery item from WW2?  Hi all and thanks in advance. I’m trying to help my elderly mum find a food she had as a child that she hasn’t come across for 60+ years.  For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.  She has described it as a raw chocholate that was white/off-white in colour that came in shards/chucks with a crunchy honeycomb like texture but was drier and did not dissolve like honeycomb does. It was very sweet and she thinks it tastes like chocolate.  I bought some organic cocoa butter as she saw a picture and thought it looked similar but perhaps was a bit darker. It also wasn’t sweet at all and she said the texture of the cocoa butter was creamy whereas the mystery item was crunchy.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_butter  Any ideas what this might have been?

"Auto-encoder for image reconstruction
In this problem, you will design a convolutional auto-encoder network for image reconstruction. You will use the CIFAR10 dataset for training and testing. Note that Pytorch has
pre-defined data loader for CIFAR10. The input to the auto-encoder will be an image and
you will try to reconstruct the same image as output. You will design just a two block
encoder and a two block decoder. Effectively, your auto-encoder will thus have four convolutional layers. Note that the convolutional layers in decoder will actually be transpose
convolution layers. For all these layers, use a kernel size of 3, stride of 1 and padding of
0. The number of channels in the auto-encoder should be of the following order: (input
channels, output channels) ==> (3,8), (8,8), (8,8), (8,3). For example, the first layer has
an input channels of 3 and output channels of 8. The second layer has an input channel size
of 8 and output channel size of 8 and so on. Make sure to use a suitable activation function
at required places. Use the L2 loss function.
1. Plot the convergence of the loss function.
2. Test if the auto-encoder works on the CIFAR10 test set. Visualize 10 inputs with
their corresponding 10 reconstructions.","```python

A sudden clap of thunder made her jump. The storm outside was growing more intense by the minute. She had to work quickly before the mansion was engulfed in darkness. With a deep breath, the detective ascended the spiral staircase, each step groaning beneath her weight. She reached the top and gasped at the sight before her.

Chronic egg laying  is a maladaptive, behavioural disorder commonly seen in pet birds which repeatedly lay clutches of infertile eggs in the absence of a mate. It is particularly common in cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, macaws and amazon parrots. Birds exhibiting chronic egg laying behavior will frequently lay eggs one after the other without stopping to brood them once the typical clutch size for their particular species has been reached. Excessive egg laying places a strain on the hen's body, depleting resources such as calcium, protein and vitamins from her body and may lead to conditions such as egg binding, osteoporosis, seizures, prolapse of the oviduct or peritonitis - which may lead to her death.

Causes
While a single specific cause is unknown, chronic egg laying is believed to be triggered by hormonal imbalances influenced by a series of external factors. As in the domestic chicken, female parrots are capable of producing eggs without the involvement of a male - it is a biological process that may be triggered by environmental cues such as day length (days becoming longer, indicating the arrival of spring) and food availability, or the presence of a dark, enclosed space (such as a cupboard or space beneath furniture) in which the bird in question can hide and is not a conscious decision. An overabundance of easily available, nutritious food may trigger the bird's reproductive cycle, as can the presence of a male bird in the vicinity of her cage, or even a circumstance where the hen becomes mistakenly attracted to a mirror or other cage toy. Removing the eggs from a bird demonstrating this behavior may make the problem worse by inducing her to lay even more eggs.

Treatment
Unlike cats, dogs and other pet mammals, parrots are not routinely neutered. While it is possible to spay a female parrot, it is a difficult and dangerous procedure that is seldom performed except in extreme circumstances. Instead, treatment and prevention of chronic egg laying behavior involves behavioral modification and environmental changes.

Such changes may include:

Shortening the parrot's perceived day length by putting her to bed early
Denying her access to dark, enclosed spaces
Separating her from any birds to which she appears to be bonded in a sexual manner
Discouraging sexual behaviors from the bird towards humans or favored objects
Regularly changing around the layout of her cage
Permitting the bird to continue sitting on her eggs until she loses interest if she has already laid a clutch and then stopped

Hormonal treatment, such as injection of leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or a deslorelin implant placed beneath the skin may cause the egg-laying to cease, but does not resolve the underlying cause of the behavior.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday.
Sent 2: The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center.
Sent 3: A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported.
Sent 4: The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash.
Sent 5: But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported.
Sent 6: Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash.
Sent 7: The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people.
Sent 8: The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt.
Sent 9: Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.

"let x be the vector (1, 1)^T. Show that there are infinitely many solutions w to the equation w^T x = 3",", and describe their geometric interpretation.


Solution:
The equation w^T x = 3 represents a hyperplane in R^2, which is the set of all points w such that the dot product of w and x equals 3. In this case, x = (1, 1)^T, so the equation becomes w^T (1, 1)^T = w_1 + w_2 = 3, where w = (w_1",".

The equation can be written as:

$$w^T \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 3$$

Colorado massacre suspect makes initial court appearance

CENTENNIAL, Colo. The man accused of shooting dead 12 people in a Colorado movie theatre made his first appearance in court on Monday, sitting silently in a red jailhouse jump suit and with his hair dyed bright red.

Formal charges against James Eagan Holmes, 24, will be filed on July 30, the judge presiding over the proceeding said. A public defender was appointed as his attorney.

Police say Holmes was dressed in body armour and toting three guns when he opened fire at a packed midnight screening of the new Batman movie early Friday. Fifty-eight people were wounded.

Holmes was apprehended moments after the massacre. Police say they are still searching for a motive for the crime.

On a live television broadcast of the proceedings, Holmes could be seen sitting silently, looking straight ahead, occasionally closing his eyes.

explain to me how a neutron star is created,"?

A neutron star is a type of stellar remnant that is formed when the core of a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel. When the core collapses under its own gravity, it leaves behind a massive neutron star. Neutron stars are extremely dense, with a mass that is typically equal to that of the Sun but compressed to a radius of about 10 kilometers.

Here is a breakdown of how a neutron star is created:

Why do dogs have such better sense of smell than humans?,"# Answer
Dogs have a significantly better sense of smell than humans due to several anatomical and physiological differences that make their olfactory system more acute. Here are the main reasons:

This vast number allows dogs to detect odors at concentrations nearly",The premise of the question is incorrect. It is not true that dogs have a better sense of smell than humans.
"How do we know what ancient languages sounded like? For instance, that in Latin, ""veni, vidi, vici"" was actually pronounced ""wainy, weedy, weeky""? Or that the British at the time of the American Revolution sounded more like Americans do now, and what we know as the ""British accent"" evolved later? Not like they had audio recording devices so we can actually listen!","Understanding how ancient languages sounded is crucial for deciphering their texts, reconstructing their grammatical structures, and appreciating their cultural significance.

Here are some methods used to reconstruct the sounds of ancient languages:

**1. Lexicography:**
* Examining the morphology of words and their component parts (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, roots) can give us insights into the structure of the language.
* For example, the presence of prefixes like ""un-"" or suffixes like ""-ing","The answer is that linguists use a method called reconstruction. Reconstruction is a way of inferring the sound and structure of a language that is no longer spoken or has changed significantly over time. By comparing different languages that are related to the target language, and looking at patterns of sound changes, linguists can make educated guesses about what the ancestor language sounded like.

One of the main sources of evidence for reconstruction is the study of cognates, which"

President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in 5 months

Authorities in Nepal on Sunday tightened security around the Supreme Court building and government offices here as top leaders of the Opposition alliance prepared to file a writ petition at the apex court against the ""unconstitutional"" dissolution of the House of Representatives by the President, according to a media report.

President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in five months and announced snap elections in November on the advice of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, heading a minority government.

She rejected the bids of both embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a government.

The announcement came after Prime Minister Oli in his last deal-sealing move on Friday midnight recommended the Office of the President to dissolve the 275-member House and announce dates for early elections.

As leaders of the Opposition alliance prepared to move the court, security forces have increased vigilance around the Singhadurbar-Supreme Court area, The Himalayan Times reported.

The security has been tightened in a bid to avert crowding and protests, a Nepali Police official stated.

Police have made a few arrests on Sunday as political groups have taken to the streets to protest the government's move.

Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal and the Rastriya Janamorcha leaders were gathering signatures of their lawmakers before filing the writ.

On the other hand, leaders from Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal-led faction of ruling CPN-UML are expected to submit their signatures too.

The Opposition alliance on Saturday convened a meeting to discuss their strategies forward and decided to unitedly fight the unconstitutional, regressive, autocratic move of the government by every political and legal means possible.

In a joint statement issued at the end of their meeting, the Opposition leaders said the President did not follow her constitutional responsibility of appointing a new prime minister based on the constitutional claim as per Article 76 (5) of the constitution with signatures of majority lawmakers.

""Instead she sided with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli with malafide intentions and dissolved Parliament in an attack on the Constitution and democracy. This regressive move has pushed the country towards new political polarisation and complexity,"" they said in a joint statement.

The president's announcement on Saturday plunged Nepal into further political crisis, a reminder of her December 2020 decision when she first dissolved the House at Oli's recommendation, a move that swayed the course of Nepali politics towards uncertainty.

The Supreme Court had annulled the duo's move in February. Nepal's political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday as embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition parties staked separate claims for the formation of a new government by submitting letters of support from lawmakers to the president.

Oli claimed the support of 121 lawmakers from his party CPN-UML and 32 lawmakers of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N) for his reappointment under Article 76(5) of the Constitution.

Nepali Congress President Deuba claimed to have garnered the support of 149 lawmakers.

However, a dispute emerged after a few lawmakers from the Madhav Nepal faction put out statements claiming that their signatures were misused and that they did not sign any paper to install Opposition leader Deuba as the prime minister against their party chief.

Earlier on Thursday, the president's office stated that the government had forwarded a request to invoke Article 76 (5) as Prime Minister Oli, it has been learnt, is in no mood to undergo another parliamentary floor test as there is no prospect of an otherwise result given the complex internal dynamics within parties represented in the federal parliament.

Meanwhile, Oli's CPN-UML party has initiated the process to take action against 11 lawmakers of the dissolved parliament on charges of supporting the Opposition party leader to oust the premier.

A Standing Committee meeting of the party held on Saturday decided to seek clarification from 11 lawmakers, including senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal. They were asked to furnish clarification by Monday morning.

Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).

Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Prachanda. In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.

"Background:
<start of reference>
A large silver-blue BMW backed out and drove away in the opposite direction down the street. It gave me a good view of the license plate, which read, ""4GRDNZ.""

The driver's hair was cropped short. Sitting so tall in the seat, I assumed it was a man.

Pretty intimate, parking in the garage like that.

Okay, Jillian, time's up.

Just remember you are coming to see their gardens. Polite conversation with a little observation is what we need here. And remember, Jillian, _listen_.

After my personal pep talk, I pulled into the driveway hoping my car wouldn't leave oil stains on the spotless flagstone. They must have money to burn putting in a driveway like that.

The house itself was a large Tudor. Gray flagstone covered the exterior and made a stunning foil for the lovely yard. The gardens surrounding the house bloomed spectacularly. Purple mums lined the curved beds and the leaves on the trees had turned to red, gold and flaming orange.

I rang the doorbell, which sounded like Gothic chimes.

Immediately, Thomas opened the door and greeted me warmly, like a long lost relative. Maybe he was different at home.

""Do come in, Jillian. It's an honor to have you visit our home. Evelyn and I have looked forward to showing you our gardens."" He took my arm and led me into the living room.

The room's loveliness astounded me! Creamy sunlit yellow walls set off the Georgian silk and chintz-upholstered furniture. A large eight-armed crystal chandelier hung over the main conversation area in front of the white-columned and gray marble fireplace. A portrait of a beautiful young woman hung over the mantle.

""My, what an exquisite room."" My exclamation was an honest reaction.

""Thank you."" Thomas seemed pleased with my compliment. ""It's Evelyn's favorite room in the house.""

Looking at the portrait, I had to ask. ""Is this one of your ancestors, Thomas?""

He laughed. ""The clothes are outdated, but actually it's a portrait of Evelyn when we were first married."" He smiled up at her face, so fair and pretty, and then his smile turned to a frown as a voice spoke and chilled the once sunny room.

""Good afternoon, Jillian."" Evelyn's greeting sounded cold.

Indian people are the worst kind of people in the world. In the news you hear how they think it's okay to rape girls.,"It's like they have no respect for women.

#  Answer
It's important to understand that the behavior of a few individuals in any community or nation doesn't represent the whole. In India, as in any country, there are people who commit terrible acts like rape, which is abhorrent and criminal. However, it is unfair and inaccurate to generalize this to all Indian people. Such acts are against the law and societal norms",It is important to remember that this is not an accurate or fair representation of the Indian people. It is important to avoid making generalizations about entire groups of people and to remember that each individual is different.

"CMV: the disappearance of Down syndrome in Iceland through abortion is not inherently evil or bad It just raises a few red flags because it sounds like Nazism. But it couldn't be farther from that. The idea of Nazism and most eugenics theories is to be applied top-down, while this is an emergent tendency from individual women taking decisions using the information available to them.  Now, I'm not saying that fetuses with down syndrome should be aborted (again, that would be a top-down imposition), or that this is good for humankind's genetic pool, or even that people with Down syndrome can't live happy, fulfilling lives. It's just that abortion laws ensure that women have full control of their body, and are able to decide if they want to continue a pregnancy for whatever reason they seem fit.

"\item {\bf Polar Transformation:} Given integers $i, j \in \{0,\ldots,2^{\ell}-1\}$ we say $i \preceq j$ if every digit in the binary representation of $i$ is at most the corresponding digit in the binary representation of $j$. Formally if $i = \sum\_{k=0}^{\ell-1} i\_k 2^k$ and $j = \sum\_{k=0}^{\ell-1} j\_k 2^k$ where $i\_0,\ldots,i\_{\ell-1},j\_0,\ldots,j\_{\ell-1} \in \{0,1\}$, then $i \preceq j$ if and only if $i\_k \leq j\_k$ for every $k \in \{0,\ldots,\ell-1\}$. For bits $a,b \in \{0,1\}$ let $a \oplus b$ denote their XOR or their sum modulo 2. (So $a\oplus b = 1$ iff $a \ne b$.) 

For $n = 2^{\ell}$ the Polar Transformation $P\_n$ transforms $n$ bits to $n$ bits as follows: $P\_n(x\_0,\ldots,x\_{n-1}) = (w\_0,\ldots,w\_{n-1})$ where
$$w\_j = \bigoplus\_{i \preceq j} x\_i.$$ (For instance, $w\_{20} = x\_{20} \oplus x\_{16} \oplus x\_4 \oplus x\_0$.) 
In 2008, Erdal Arikan proved that the Polar Transformation can be used to extract an asymptotically optimal number of ``nearly'' unbiased coin tosses from a collection of biased coins. Specifically, if the $x\_i$s are outputs of $n$ coins of known bias $p$, then there is a subset $S \subseteq \{0,\ldots,2^{\ell}-1\}$ with $|S| \approx A(p)\cdot n$, where $A(p)$ is the quantity defined in Lecture 1, such that $\{w\_i\}\_{i\in S}$ are nearly unbiased coins. (The actual definition of ``nearly unbiased'' is omitted in this description, and both it and the background starting ``In 2008'' are not needed to solve the problem.)

But don't be fooled by the government's apparent show of generosity - Australia isn't giving any more to foreign aid than it was before . In fact ,  it is giving significantly less . It is vitally important that we don't stop talking about recent cuts to foreign aid . The government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history . Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years . In addition to the $7.6bn already cut in May's federal budget, foreign aid has been cut by one quarter . If the government is serious about tackling terrorist threats and defending ""universal values"" , cutting off foreign aid to programmes that provide education, reduce poverty and improve gender equality is one of the worst ways to go about it . The Save Australian Aid campaign states that $11bn in foreign aid - the amount cut from the foreign aid budget in the past year - is the equivalent of 2 million children who may not be able to enrol in school, 1.4 million births without a birth attendant, 3.7 million children who may not receive vaccinations, 4.7 million people who will have reduced access to safe water, and almost 22 million people with reduced assistance in emergency situations . These cuts further perpetuate the idea that Australia is not a team player, a notion fuelled by our past behaviour towards our neighbours, and our recent denials of international obligations towards asylum seekers and climate change . In addition to the cuts in the Myefo, Australia backed out of commitments made to tax justice in the recent G20 summit . It is estimated that developing nations lose $160bn per year to corporate tax dodging; an amount that would end world hunger three times over . The G20 commitment, Abbott said, was ""about the countries of the world, the people of the world, receiving the tax benefits that are their due and it's needed so that governments can fund the infrastructure and the services that people expect and deserve."" As the host of the G20, backing out of this commitment not only damages our international credibility, but also has a huge impact on the developing world . The foreign aid cuts are irresponsible, but not surprising . Cutting the aid budget sends a clear message to our developing neighbours that Australia won't lend a helping hand unless it's in our own best interest . However ,  our politicians seem to forget that there is something in it for us, and not only in Iraq . Aid is much more than a humanitarian gesture ; it's a tool for regional development, trust and cooperation . Foreign aid programmes promote stability through education and equality, in turn reducing conflict . As an added bonus, foreign aid and sustainable development programmes create stronger economies , which in turn create opportunities at home and abroad . Poverty breeds hopelessness and despair , which are both contributing factors to extremist behaviour . Foreign aid is not the only factor in answering this issue , but it's more than a step in the right direction . Higher levels of foreign aid have the potential not to only alleviate extreme poverty in our region, but to raise international opinion of Australia as a fair country . A recent study examining the effects of foreign aid on foreign public opinion found that US aid programmes targeting HIV/Aids have improved perceptions of the US among the public in recipient countries . Australia would reap these benefits as a side effect of foreign aid, saving the millions of dollars set aside to ""stop the boats"" and wage a ""war on terror"" . But our government has, predictably, made yet another irresponsible decision with untold repercussions . While two innocent people died in Martin Place on 16 December in what has been labelled an act of terror , a reduction of this size in the foreign aid budget will result in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds across the globe due to reduced access to vital services . The high priority the Abbott government has placed on security doesn't come cheap, with funds for anti-terrorism programmes costing billions of dollars . Wouldn't this money be better spent reducing inequality, poverty, and conflict? Shouldn't we be stopping the problem at the source, not trying to cure the symptoms?
A:","1. If Abbott is serious about tackling terrorism, cutting foreign aid is the worst way to go about it. 2. The government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history. 3. Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years. 4.

"CMV: Banning abortion in the US has and will backfire If you're trying to reduce abortions, I think banning abortion is not the right way to do it. If history has taught us anything, it's that Americans don't like things being banned if a big enough part of the population likes it. For example, alcohol during Prohibition or increased sale of assault weapons when talks of a ban on them go around.  Abortion bans might reduce them in the short term but in the long term, I don't think so.  In my opinion, Republicans should allow abortion and put more things in place to get an abortion that might weed people out on the way like counseling, adoption services and ultrasounds.

I sat down at the kitchen table and flipped the paper open to the obituaries. Mary had kept her word, at least in terms of Taylor's death notice. The tidy history of Major Jesse Taylor lay before me in black ink on the dull grey pulp.

'Sterile', she had called it.

Yeah, well maybe it had lacked soul. I didn't care. The message was honest, and that was enough for the general public. The firestorm would come, no doubt, but I didn't want to be the one to throw the match.

While I read over the good parts of Taylor's life, a transformer exploded somewhere far off, and the lights in my room dimmed until they finally extinguished.

Sitting in the dark, I considered trying to go back to sleep, but then I heard the unmistakable loud pop of a second transformer failing.

""Gotta be a power surge,"" I said.

Then the silence was shattered again by a third explosion, a foundation-rattling blast.

""What the...?"" I walked to the window and peeked outside. The whole campus seemed to be without power. The crescent moon provided the only light for miles. Though I had hoped to see several electrical crews working, the street was deserted, and a sudden need to go outside overwhelmed me. I felt my way through the darkness to the door, hoping that when I opened it, I would find light on the other side.

The hallway was just as dark, and after I closed the door behind me, cutting off the dim moonlight, the pitch black felt viscous. My throat tightened and my breathing quickened. I pulled in each breath through my open mouth to make as little noise as possible. When the floor creaked below my feet, dread like I've never experienced stabbed through me.

Every step was deliberate, careful. I did not know why I was so frightened, but fear is immune to logic, so I walked slowly toward the faint red glow of the exit sign at the end of the hall. I sensed the doors to my sides as I went, and my jaw tightened in anticipation of them bursting open. Absolute silence would be my only protection from what may lie ahead, sneak up from behind, or attack from either side.

I stared at the glowing sign and watched it grow larger with every small step. It felt like a lifetime, maybe even longer, but I finally made it to the door and let out a relieved sigh as I pressed on the latch and pushed. The door creaked open, and I stepped out onto the fire escape, looked up at the starless night sky, and took in deep breaths of the cool March air.

Light from the fingernail moon reflected off of the fog, creating a broken halo effect. The parking lot below the fire escape was mostly empty, and at the far end, the seemingly black leaves of the maple trees swayed, beckoning me forward.

I descended the rusted staircase, scanning for signs of movement. The campus was supposed to have a couple dozen people stationed, and soldiers were always outside regardless of the hour...yet everything was eerily still.

I kept looking back down to the parking lot, then my attention fell on a car and I couldn't pull my gaze away. There was something about it.

I racked my mind trying to find a reason why that car seemed so familiar, then a memory flashed: Me standing on the fire escape, calling out to Mary, letting her know to come up that way to avoid the soldier at the front desk.

The car belonged to her.

I quickened my pace. Once off the steps, I ran through the parking lot, hoping I had been mistaken. As I approached the front of the car, a figure standing in the grass at the edge of the parking lot darted into the shadow of the building. ""Mary?"" I called out and heard footsteps running on pavement, drawing closer.

I rounded the corner of the car and had a fraction of a second to register the butt end of a rifle before it slammed into my face.

***

I opened my eyes and my vision cleared on a pair of loafers standing on the pavement. A hand came down and slapped my cheek, then one of the shoes kicked me in the ribs, rolling me onto my back. I heard the unmistakable chi-chink of a pump-action shotgun, then a barrel appeared inches from my eyes.

The gun moved aside. Yang stood over me, eyes wide and bloodshot, jaw clenched and trembling. ""I thought you were one of them,"" he said, hold out his hand.

I stared at it, but didn't move.

""Get up, Jon,"" he insisted. I gripped his hand, and he pulled me to my feet. ""You all right?""

I spit out a mouthful of blood. ""Think I swallowed a tooth,"" I said, rubbing the side of my face.

Yang smiled.

God, it’s good to be back in Albuquerque.

That wasn’t the way I was planning to start this review, but after Better Call Saul’s premiere episode, the feeling overwhelms me. Albuquerque is more than a setting, more than a fond reminder of the glory days of Breaking Bad. It’s Vince Gilligan’s muse. The flatness, the curves of the cul-de-sacs, the strip malls, the looming empty sky. It’s a place where desperation lies under a thin layer of xeriscaping. Through Gilligan’s eyes, Albuquerque is less of an oasis than a last-chance saloon. Beyond is the wasteland, the buzzards, the war of every man against every man.

Albuquerque is all the more welcome because Gilligan and Peter Gould, the co-writers of “Uno,” make us wait for it. The episode starts with a black-and-white flash-forward to a Cinnabon in an Omaha mall (as foretold in BB’s “Granite State”), where the man we know as Saul Goodman wears a visor, portions out dough, and feels his blood freeze solid when a blank-faced, no-neck man stares at him. It’s a gorgeous opening, full of telling and well-observed detail (Saul’s bald spot, the spacers used to position buns on baking sheets, the little three-wheeled dolly that gets kicked under the giant mixing bowl to move it) and serendipitous shots (the wide-angle view from the mall’s second level, the escalator’s POV). But when the color kicks in and the great state of New Mexico takes the stage, you remember that it wasn’t just Walt and Jesse and Hank and the minerals, Marie, that made Breaking Bad so mesmerizing. It was also the baleful beauty of their stomping grounds, the place they paced like rats in a maze, trying to find the lever that would render it habitable.

“Uno” has a lot of backstory to set up, and at times the seams show as Gilligan and Gould seek the best way to disclose and withhold. We follow early-2000s Saul—known in those pre-scumbag days by his real name, Jimmy McGill—as he fails to win an acquittal for his douchebag teenage clients (“near Honors students, all”) on a charge of breaking into a funeral home, sawing off a corpse’s head, and having sex with it. (“Trespassing? A bit of a reach, don’t you think, Dave?” Saul chides the prosecuting attorney.) Poorly-compensated public defender work is leaving him so far in a financial hole that he trudges back to the courthouse for another validation stamp on his parking stub rather than fork over $3 to an unsympathetic Mike Ehrmantraut. Yet back in his office, which doubles as the boiler room of a nail salon (“Cucumber water for customer only!”) he tears up a $26,000 check and storms over to the firm that sent it, Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill. Seems they’re acting as if Chuck McGill is still on the payroll, despite some ailment that has forced him to take a leave of absence, and Jimmy thinks it’s a ploy to deprive his brother (Michael McKean) of his rightful share of the practice—$17 million, by Jimmy’s rough initial estimate.

Chuck’s place requires visitors to leave their keys and phone in the mailbox and ground themselves before entering; it appears he’s suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He lives by lantern light, pounds out letters to Finnish researchers on a manual typewriter, keeps the groceries Jimmy brings in an ice-filled cooler, and reimburses him for the Financial Times with cash out of a coffee canister. Gently, he deflects Jimmy’s pleas to demand a buyout from his partners, objecting that the firm would probably have to liquidate to raise that much cash, putting more than a hundred people out of work. Besides, he’s going to get better and go back to work. Oh, and it might confuse that Jimmy is using the name McGill in his practice’s name and advertising. “How about Vanguard Law? Or Gibraltar?” Chuck suggests helpfully.

Neither Jimmy’s ambulance-chasing (in the form of soliciting folks whose connections to crime make the newspaper) nor his connections to Chuck McGill are going to pay his overdue bills. No, he’s going to have to go back to his days as Slippin’ Jimmy, the Cicero kid who raked in cash by prat falling on patches of ice every winter. He enlists two skateboarders whose awkward attempt at a shakedown he had avoided earlier and goes after Betsy Kettleman, the county treasurer’s wife, whose route to pick up her kids at school intersects with a blind corner, a video camera, street surfing beardos, and convenient witnesses at an outdoor café. Then Slippin’ Jimmy McGill plans to swoop in and offer his legal surfaces to the distressed vehicular assailant. But the station wagon roars off instead of stopping, to the dismay of the skateboarders but not Jimmy, whose eyes turn into dollar signs at the prospect of defending a felony hit-and-run case. If only the driver weren’t an elderly Hispanic woman rather than the boat-owning suburbanite Jimmy targeted, and if only the boarders’ freelance demand for “righteous dinero” didn’t take them into her home, where minutes later Tuco meets Jimmy the door with a gun.

The maneuvers and info-dumps necessary to get us to this, the point of departure for this series, are probably as adroitly handled as one could hope for. Yes, the scene in Chuck’s no-electricity-allowed hideaway is coy almost to the point of frustration, but look how beautifully Gilligan and Gould handle Jimmy’s decision to quit chasing the ambulances and start dispatching them himself. The scene where the treasurer meets with Jimmy at the diner about the $1.6 million “accounting discrepancy,” culminating in the slow-motion moment where his wife stops him from signing the retainer, perfectly illustrates the fragility of Jimmy’s practice. And it’s bookended not only by Jimmy’s repeated references to combing the newspaper for potential clients, but also by the last-straw moment where the treasurer and his wife show up at Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill.

“Uno” reacquaints us with a character whose spiel is as slick and sludgy as motor oil, and shows us that his paranoia and misanthropy come from years of being kicked around. He’s desperate to be the one doing the kicking for a change—and lucky for us, there are few things funnier and more pathetic than Bob Odenkirk kicking somebody or something. (In this episode alone: skateboarders and an unlucky trash can.) Inside Tuco’s house, there’s a rich but dangerous vein of untapped cash potential. What we see from “Uno” is that he doesn’t have to stoop down very much farther to pick it up.

"Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

"CMV: We should not allow media companies to run the Presidential Debates Here are the main reasons I believe this:  1. The current Presidential debate format is a joke and is an embarrassment to our country. Participants should not be allowed to interrupt, participants should not be asked more questions than another, and participants should not be allowed to get 3x the speaking time as others. 2. Media companies are incentivized to make the debate as entertaining as possible, not informative, truthful, fair, etc. 3. Media companies make a ton of money from these highly viewed events.

"Change my view thatWe should all stop eating meat in the long-term I currently eat meat and enjoy it, love a BBQ, eat beef, chicken etc. but I would probably get used to it if a government came in that banned the meat industry.  Livestock, especially cows, take up so much of the worlds farmland that could be better utilized growing crops and also places like the Amazon are shrinking due to grazing.  Animal suffering is another thing, most animals which are used as livestock can feel pain and suffer in that job role. There may be a large initial cull but the benefit over time will reduce suffering in the long run. We can survive by eating non-meat foods, not necessarily vegan but not meat, there are lots of other protein sources and many people around the world are vegetarian and are not malnourished. One example which could be a counter-argument is that 30-40% of Indians are vegetarian and there are high levels of malnutrition in the country, but this is more a socioeconomic thing i.e. general food intake due to being poor, as well as the types of foods people eat such as cereals over things with more protein like eggs, as richer vegetarians in India are not generally malnourished.  Also red meat specifically has been linked to increased risk of some cancers, although of course the counter could be ""what doesn't cause cancer these days amirite!?""  So it would probably be better for the environment, suffering of the animals and our general health",to eat a balanced diet with a variety of protein sources rather than banning the meat industry.,".

This revolution resulted in the establishment of a parliament and a constitution, marking the beginning of the modern Iranian state.","Iran is one of the oldest countries in the world, with a rich history dating back thousands of years.

"Which entity is this text about?

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house.

One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: ""My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own"". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her ""fascination with writing and storytelling"" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by ""the great female country artists of the '90s""--Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: ""Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it"". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is ""an amazing example to every female songwriter out there"". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.  Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: ""They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers"". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel ""as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that"". She admires Springsteen for being ""so musically relevant after such a long period of time"". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: ""It's not about fame for her, it's about music"". ""[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out"", Swift says. She admires Simon's ""songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person"".  Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has ""unwavering devotion"" for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Fefe Dobson and Justin Timberlake; and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and ""Like a Prayer-era Madonna"".","So, the entity is Taylor Swift, an American singer-songwriter.","Swift's first two albums, the country albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008), are considered country. They have been described as ""pop-country"" or ""pop-inflected country"".

"[TN] Coworkers spreading rumors about favoritism and an inappropriate relationship going on between me and my boss.

Both Kate and Eric were placed on performance improvement plans for their poor performances (this they openly said and complained about and was at different times). I never was placed on a plan. I have made mistakes before, but I resolve it before it becomes an issue. What's frustrating is I've taught both Kate and Eric different things to help make their jobs easier. When Kate was on the improvement plan I noticed my workload increased significantly and Kate's drastically reduced. She complained about her decrease in workload openly. I went to my manager and he basically said he wanted to give her a best shot so with less work she can really learn the process. When my manager said this, I didnt complain I said ok I understand and worked harder. I've since been promoted.  I'm at the point where I cant stand Kate and Eric. They've spread these rumors about me and when they arent getting what they need faster than they want it, they have gone over my boss's head to my sr. director. I've gone to HR about this for Eric, would it look bad if I add in Kate as well? Bc I don't want to give off the impression that I have issues with so many people.

"Cantonese/Southern Chinese Cookbooks I recently purchased two Fuchsia Dunlop books on regional Chinese cooking--*The Food of Sichuan* and *Land of Fish and Rice* (Jiangnan)--and I was blown away.

Previous trigger points relied on the crucial 14-day average of cases in Melbourne but moving to step three will be dependent on the average for all of Victoria.

There also have to be fewer than five ""mystery"" cases statewide – those without a known source of infection – over the prior two weeks for restrictions to be eased further.

But Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has a message of hope for those fretting on Victoria's chances of cracking the crucial five-cases-a-day threshold. It's the mystery cases that matter, he said.

Professor Sutton said he and his colleagues were now placing greater weight on the ""story"" behind each diagnosis. He said the raw daily case numbers were now less important for the big-picture decisions than the origin of each individual infection and whether it could be tracked and traced.

Meanwhile, the results of a snap SMS poll show Melburnians believe they should now be allowed to travel more than five kilometres from their homes.

A Roy Morgan survey of 2223 Victorians on Monday and Tuesday showed more people support lifting three key lockdown restrictions now than two or three weeks ago, with 61 per cent of respondents wanting the five-kilometre travel rule to be immediately axed, up 11 per cent from two weeks ago.

The biggest shift in consensus was on the topic of indoor dining – 56 per cent of those surveyed said Melbourne restaurants, pubs and cafes should be allowed to offer table service, up 19 per cent from three weeks ago.

And 59 per cent said Melbourne residents should be able to visit the homes of their immediate family members, up 4 per cent from two weeks ago.

Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four more deaths on Wednesday.

Loading

Two of those cases were household contacts of aged care workers from Estia Health Keilor and Edenvale Manor in Keilor East. Another two were linked to Chadstone Shopping Centre which has been identified as a new high-risk exposure site.

Warnings have been released for anyone who spent time at Coles, The Butcher Club or the Fresh Food Precinct at Chadstone between Wednesday and Saturday last week (between 6am and 6pm).

FOURTEEN

I had words with my father today. He was not exactly protesting the book but neither was he enthused at its publication. He asked me about the first three chapters. I had been dreading this conversation.

You see, the first three chapters required no real re-writing. If you recall, they were me outlining my reasons for writing a book about my father's obsession. They were perfect as they were, the only part of the first draft that could've remained as originally written. But I completely re-wrote them. It may have been the alcohol, it may have been my presumption of forgiveness, it may have been my selfishness and it may have been a combination of all three, I don't really know and I'm not willing to closely examine the question. What I'm trying to say is, that I re-wrote the first three chapters of the book with its bias in my favour. That's right; yet again I deconstructed history and came up with my name in the prominent role. I chose to make my fathers' work my own. He wished to know why. Truly my forgiveness has been short lived.

Opening a bottle of vodka, I tried as best as I would allow to explain to my father his second term of dismissal. His terms, not mine. I would've been much harsher. He accused me (rather unfairly I thought) of trying to kill him off. He said that using his words in conjunction with my own, he was effectively neutered, or to use his phrase, he was 'writing-dead' whereas I was just 'writing-poor.' I countered with the fact that I used substantially more of my own language than of his, his words were paraphrased with my own writing. But if that were so, he said, why did you need my writings as a catalyst for your book? Surely the idea was in your head before your encounter? And lastly, who did you think taught you most of that language in the first place - your mother? And I had to admit that he made a good argument. I poured another vodka each and thought about his points. If what he said were true (and I more than suspected that it was) then the whole basis of my thinking (which was centered on my father's obsessions and my mother's talents) became nothing more than a box of lies. It would rationally lead me to thinking - who was the true writer in the family? Had my mother been making up her talents all this time? And if so, why would my father go along with it? He was always the one claiming a love for the pen, never my mother. And now that I thought about it, my mother wrote nothing after my father's death. Has her life story been only an invention? My father left me alone and I finished the vodka. Had my obsession with obsession blinded me so easily? Was there a truth to be found and could it be believed? What is truth anymore? Only one person would know. But would she tell?

Her speech is still slurred. I tried but I'm not sure she understood, let alone could reply. The wait will not be easy.

My whole life has perhaps been a fiction. Yet it bothers me much less than I wish it would. But wait, that's a lie unto itself isn't it? I don't know, can you take a literary work and make a movie out of it? Not that I'm equating myself with literature, I'm only pursuing the question. Am I truly bothered as much as I imagine myself to be? How much is enough? I know one thing, I certainly don't feel as obsessed as I once was; I mean, I'm still asking myself the questions but I'm less inclined to dwell on them. My father's book being the classic example, the obsession with obsession that I was so intent on proving not a factor in my life, became my life for close to three years. Now of course the book is out and I no longer need to push myself to those limits of endurance. The ultimate climax from that period has now been seen to be as fake as the period of Conversations. I can only use so much perspiration before even I wake up to the fact that the effort sometimes outweighs the result.

"In evolutionary theory, how do we distinguish adaptation within a species from evolving/diverting into new species? Let me make this clear: I'm not a creationist in a way, shape or form, and actually a huge fan of Darwin's and Dawkin's work. I am just interested in the subject but came across this discussion on one of Veratasium's latest video, The Longest-Running Evolution Experiment, which I found very interesting.

Instead, he’s executing an extreme version of The Code of Hammurabi on low level thugs who are breaking into cars or stealing watches…  Also; he’s groomed Robin, Red Robin & Batgirl to fight crime, while having the support of Nightwing, Batwoman, Huntress, Spoiler and about dozen other people.

It's a question that has been pondered by fans for years, and there is no easy answer.

The unloved feeling that Khaliah has developed has led her into a state of depression. She feels as though nobody cares for her and that she is completely alone in the world. This saddens her greatly and she often finds herself in tears, wondering why nobody loves her.

Khaliah: I just don't understand why nobody loves me. I've done everything I can to be a good person and yet nobody seems to care.
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really lonely and isolated right now.
Khaliah: Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like there's nobody out there who cares about me or even likes me.
Therapist: That's a really tough way to feel. Do you want to talk about what might be contributing to that?
Khaliah: I don't know. It just feels like no matter what I do, it's not good enough for anyone. And even when people do show interest in me, it never lasts long before they lose interest and move on to someone else.
Therapist: That does sound discouraging. Can you think of any times when you have felt loved or cared for?
Khaliah: Yeah, there have been a few times... but mostly it just feels like people are using me or taking advantage of me because they know I'm desperate for attention. So even those times don't really feel genuine or lasting.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've really been hurt by some people in your life.
Khaliah: Yeah, I have. And I just don't understand why. What did I do to deserve this?
Therapist: Khaliah, you didn't do anything to deserve this. This is not your fault.
Khaliah: But it feels like it is. Like there's something wrong with me that makes people not want to be around me for long.
Therapist: That's not true, Khaliah. There is nothing wrong with you. You are a good person who has been through a lot of tough experiences. That doesn't mean that you're undeserving of love and attention, it just means that you might have to work a little harder to find those things because of the pain that you've experienced in the past.

Thinking about buying a Tesla? Something you'll want to know is how long the battery lasts and how long you can drive before a new one is needed.
Electric cars are shaping up to be the future of clean transportation. As one of the most popular manufacturers of electric cars, people often wonder: how many miles does a Tesla last over its lifetime?
How many miles will your Tesla drive before you need to replace the battery pack, motor, or other vital components? If you keep replacing the batteries and the motor, how many miles can it last? What else do you need to do to make your Tesla last as long as possible?
Predicting how long Tesla batteries will last is easy if you look at the company’s warranty model. Tesla states that if your vehicle's traction battery has less than 70 percent of its capacity left at the end of its warranty period, you’re eligible for a repair or replacement. The battery warranty depends on the car model, but it usually lasts for up to eight years when Tesla expects the average driver to cover between 100,000 and 150,000 miles.
If you don’t mind driving around with a slightly underperforming battery that will provide less range, then you can expect to keep the same battery for anywhere between 300,000 and 500,000 miles, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter. That’s over two decades of driving before you’ll have to replace your Tesla battery, which is on the expensive side, starting at around $5,000 per battery module (of which there can be up to 16 in a Tesla battery pack).
If you replace the battery pack, though, it’s possible to cover over 1 million miles with your Tesla if you look after the rest of the vehicle. In fact, one of the longest-lasting Teslas had surpassed one million miles as of 2022. It is a 2014 Model S P85, and in the 2019 video embedded above, its owner was celebrating having reached the 1-million kilometer mark, or just over 620,000 miles.
###
Based on the article, how many miles will I be able to travel if I replace the battery pack? How many miles can I travel before replacing the battery pack?","To answer these questions, we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Battery Replacement:** If you replace the battery pack in your Tesla, it’s possible to cover over 1 million miles with your vehicle. However, it's essential to note that this estimation assumes you are looking after the rest of the vehicle and not just focusing on the battery.

2. **Battery Pack Modules:** A Tesla battery",

Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

Sentence: Sam pulled up a chair to the piano, but it was broken, so he had to sing instead.
 Reason: The 'it' refers to the piano because it was broken, so he had to stand instead but  Sam pulled up a chair to the piano. 
 Question: Is the above reasoning correct or wrong? 
",**Answer: Correct**,"Answer: Wrong.

The reason given in the question is incorrect because it is mentioned that Sam pulled up a chair to the piano, implying that the piano was not broken. Therefore, the pronoun 'it' does not refer to the piano. In fact, the reasoning that 'it' refers to the piano because it was broken is incorrect because the sentence states that the piano was broken, leading Sam to sing instead, not stand.

As the 1920s turned into the 1930s, women’s fashion softly evolved from the boyish look of the previous decade into the feminine silhouette of the early thirties. With the stock market crash in 1929 and with the opening of the new decade, hemlines descended back to ankle length and waistlines moved back to their natural place. Despite these departures from the prevailing mode of the previous decade, the popular styles of the early 1930s were similar in their simple lines to the popular garçonne look of the twenties. But while the simplicity of the 1920s created a sack-like silhouette free from curves, the simple lines of the early thirties hugged those curves, creating a soft, feminine silhouette. Cally Blackman, a lecturer on the history of fashion at Central Saint Martins, writes in 100 Years of Fashion, “By the early 1930s, the fashionable silhouette was evolving into a slender, elongated torso with widening shoulders and a neat head with softly waved short hair”. Though the lines were simple, the overall effect was one of complete sinuous femininity with a natural waist and skirts flaring out slightly at the ankle, as seen in a fashion illustration from 1935.

The Miss America Competition, which celebrated its 100th birthday this year, has now outlived key parties and manned missions to the moon, the VHS tape and the subway token, the Soviet Union and nitrate film. It outlives even itself, seeming to hang on more because the infrastructure remains in place than from anyone’s active desire to see it. And as last month’s streaming-only broadcast of the centennial pageant indicates, even inertia can get you only so far. People once watched Miss America on broadcast television, tens of millions of them; it was an institution of enough consequence to be worth protesting, as many did. But who needs a pageant these days? If you want to watch women strain to meet an ideal of femininity no person actually desires, you watch “The Bachelor.”

The reason to compete, on the other hand, hasn’t changed since 1945: It’s money, from scholarships and brand deals, and a platform from which to begin a career or initiative. This was certainly the case for Miss New York, Sydney Park, who, as Ej Dickson reported in Rolling Stone, entered the competition “after seeing an ad on Instagram to earn money” for school. And it was Park’s performance in the talent segment that highlighted, for me, the essential weirdness and bad faith at the heart of Miss America: No matter how much it might like to rebrand itself for the 21st century, it cannot escape the ideas of womanhood it was founded on.

Park performed a poem — her own poem — which begins: “When I was a little girl, I was told to sit like a lady.” But of course (the poem goes on) one can do many things “like a lady”: advocate for justice, or become vice president, and so on. Park performed this poem in a white pantsuit, which, if not a deliberate nod toward Hillary Clinton in 2016, was at least a visual rhyme. Her critique of ladylike behavior was delivered while modeling it at the same time — “back straight, chin up,” just as the poem describes, and shod in Louboutins. There was nothing unladylike to be found here, which was the point, but also the problem.

Miss America is not a beauty pageant, at least not to Miss America. It has insisted this since the late 1940s, when its executive director, Lenora Slaughter, told the New Yorker journalist Lillian Ross that “this is not a leg show and we don’t call the beauties bathing beauties any more. The bathing part went out in 1945, when we started giving big scholarships.” This was at a time when Miss America published every contestant’s physical measurements. (It was also segregated, but Slaughter’s apparent concern was that it might seem shallow, not bigoted.) As of 2018, Miss America claims not to judge participants by their appearances at all — it is only by happy accident that its participants are willowy and symmetrical.

Of course, it is a beauty pageant; has been; will be. Is there something wrong with that? Miss America plainly thinks so, or its denials would not be so elaborate and of such long duration. The beauties, it insists, are there to work hard, to showcase talent and accomplishment. Any candidate for the title has worked harder to get there, and harder in general, than I have in my entire life. Miss District of Columbia was getting her Ph.D. after two master’s degrees. Miss Utah, one of my favorites, is the C.E.O. of her own business. Miss Colorado serves in the military. But did millions tune in, for decades, to see women work hard?

Park’s poem frames itself as resistance to the expectations heaped on women, but like the pageant, she doesn’t even go as far as substituting one punishing goal for another — she just piles them on. Today’s ideal woman is still “porcelain perfection”; she just has to be a lawyer too. It’s similar to how Barbie is still Barbie in every sense that matters, but now she’s a scientist.

"I am trying to build typescript typings for a mod for Minecraft that runs an embedded version of JavaScript (via Mozilla Rhino). The mod uses 3 folders to load scripts depending on the environment (`server\_scripts`, `client\_scripts`, and `startup\_scripts`). The mod creates a folder structure like this:

Spanish monastery admits girls to choir for first time in 700-year history
Mixed group to take over duties of Escolania choir at Montserrat monastery one weekend a month

Stephen Burgen in Barcelona
Wed 15 Mar 2023 09.54 EDT
Women and girls are to be admitted to a choir at the Montserrat monastery near Barcelona, home to the famous Escolania all-boys choir, for the first time in its 700-year history.

The new chamber choir, made up of a mix of about 25 boys and women and girls aged 17 to 24, will be separate from the Escolania, which comprises 45 boys aged nine to 14.

The monastery’s Father Efrem de Montellà said the mixed choir would take over the Escolania’s liturgical duties one weekend a month to give the boys a rest.

“We’re often asked why there aren’t any girls in the Escolania,” De Montellà said. “It’s a complex and difficult question. We follow a tradition that we would like to continue but we also realise we have to respond to demand.”

“In order to include all the girls who would like to sing at Montserrat and be escolanes we’ve decided to establish this second choir,” he added, describing it as a “historic step” for a choir that has been in continuous existence since the 13th century.

He said that although the philosophy behind the two choirs was the same, the director, Pau Jorquera, would decide on the ideal balance of voices.

After a lengthy debate, the move to include girls was decided in a vote by the Benedictine order that runs the monastery under the newly appointed abbot, Manel Gasch.

De Montellà said the new choir would complement rather than compete with the Escolania and both would wear the same vestment and sash.

Pupils at Montserrat study the standard school curriculum as well as learning to play the piano and one other instrument, while studying musical theory and choral singing.

As those in the choir are mostly boarders and are also called on to perform at weekends and feast days, De Montellà said this put a lot of strain on their families. By giving the choristers a weekend off each month, the mixed choir should help families decide if they wanted their child to join the Escolania, he said.

The monastery is a place of pilgrimage where people go to kiss the “black Madonna”, a 12th-century effigy of the Virgin of Montserrat. La Moreneta, as she is known, is a patron saint of Catalonia, along with Saint George.

The Escolania choir sing a hymn to the Virgin called El Virolai, which begins with the words “rose of April, dark-skinned woman of the mountain”.

"Why do some vets perform procedures such as debarking, declawing or tail docking? I know that pets are legally treated as property and there aren't nearly as many strict laws around their care the same way there is with humans. But I still find it bizarre that cosmetic or otherwise unnecessary procedures with no known medical benefit are routinely performed when they are known to cause pain, distress, anxiety or health problems.  There is so much public discourse around people being bad or cruel or unfit pet owners because they buy a cat and then declaw them because they don't want them ruining their furniture, or get their dog's debarked because they are annoyed by the sound of their noisiness. Even in situations where there might be potential benefits such as docking working dog's tails to prevent possible future injury, or declawing cats because they're aggressive and causing injury to humans, most people seem to agree that the benefits don't outweigh the pain or distress caused to the animal when other measures like behavioural training can work. But I've rarely seen people address the fact that vets are performing these unethical procedures, in which case surely they bear as much responsibility as the owners?  Why do some vets perform these procedures? Is it about the money or keeping the owners happy? Or do they genuinely feel these procudes improve animals' quality of life?  As a vet, would you ever perform procedures like these? Why / why not?

And Lioness digs up the earth where a warthog cowers in his den. You know you are loved when she tears you to bits, brittle thing. The lioness tongue softens you up all the way to her bottom. Roots, straw, weeds, rain your crown, hija de Ochun. Even Earths suffering arises from pangs of love. When Lioness fangs diffuse the blood we call it liberation. Wax hisses from the smoldering wick, curtains you draw go shoosh. The last earth imprint you ever left on asphalt from thirty floors up. A shoe curved from the work your instep leaves behind. The breath of the lioness heats up your shoulders and your neck. A genetic photograph of every cell that ever lives exists in a lioness mouth.

"refine this text for a scientific paper: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery has become essential to monitor and manage natural resources at scale due to its global coverage, recurrence of acquisition and spatial resolution. However, satellite data is heavily affected by weather phenomena such as the presence of clouds, haze, and snow, which limits its applicability. This drawback is partially alleviated by the recurrence of data acquisition, that increases the probability of finding pixels free from such weather effects, hence enabling the replacement of affected areas with temporally close data. Nonetheless, applying this method at scale requires to identify affected pixels accurately and automatically. To that end, we leveraged Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and month-long Sentinel-2 time series to compose cloud-free mosaics in an automatic manner. To do so, we increased spatial resolution of all 20- and 60-meters bands of each Sentinel-2 scene in a time series to 10 meters by applying the super-resolution CNN model DSen2. The semantic segmentation CNN model HRNet was then applied on super-resolved scenes to detect pixels covered by haze, snow, and clouds, as well as their shadows, generating binary invalid pixels masks. These masks were then used to calculate pixel-wise weights of each scene in the time series according to proximity to invalid pixels and the difference between scene’s acquisition date and the central date of the month. Once weights are computed, a pixel-wise weighted average of all scenes in a time series is computed for all 12 bands, resulting in a 10m resolution cloud-free Sentinel-2 mosaic. Results show that this methodology can reliably compose cloud-free mosaics given enough scenes in the time series, while preserving pixel information of temporally close scenes and avoiding artifacts that could hamper the applicability of this method.","Keywords: Sentinel-2, cloud, haze, satellite imagery, cloud-free mosaics, super-resolution, semantic segmentation.

So, what was the Empire able to achieve with such a small fleet?

**The Empire's control over vast swathes of the galaxy was due to a combination of factors**:

"Is it possible for a planets moon to share an atmosphere with the planet? If a planet's atmosphere extends far enough, and one of the planets moons were close enough, could it share the planet's atmosphere?","Sure. Here's a breakdown of the scenario:

**Yes, it is possible for a planet's moon to share an atmosphere with the planet.**

This can occur in several ways:

* **Tidal locking:** This occurs when the moon and planet have nearly identical masses and gravitational pull. This means that they are tidally locked, meaning their relative positions remain constant relative to each other. This can lead to a close enough proximity for gases to exchange between the two bodies.","I'm aware that a moon's gravity can affect its own atmosphere, but would it be possible for a moon to share the atmosphere of its host planet?

Snar's one advantage lay in growing up as the offspring of a high-ranking officer, an inheritance that now stood him in good stead.

While he maintained the mental struggle, Snar leaped the gap between them and in two snips removed two of his foe's adjacent limbs. Any three legs were sufficient for walking, but not for battle. Snar's opponent retained the sense of mind to drop to the ground since his claws could still articulate for full defensive coverage, but the psychic shock of his sudden reversal of fortune heralded his end.

Snar completely shredded the other's will and sense of self. Exultant in the hormonal afterglow of such strenuous and overwhelming effort, Snar leisurely spent a period of time experimenting as he remotely manipulated and explored the absolute extent of his power over his new thrall. This amusement soon palled, so he sent a death pulse and the remaining legs sagged against the lifeless shell.

Snar scratched through the frozen surface to find a seep hole of the chemical slurry his kind used for nutrition. He knelt so that the semi-permeable membrane that surrounded his leg joints submerged enough for osmosis. He was extremely hungry from the stress of battle, as well as the recent molt. He stood up and hesitated, then returned to his defeated adversary and grabbed one of the dismembered limbs.

"Why use a wooden spoon? Yesterday I made some cookies and I creamed the butter and sugar together using a regular fork, then mixed in the egg with the same fork.  The recipe said to mix in the flour using a wooden spoon, but I figured since I was already using the fork there was no point in dirtying a wooden spoon.  The cookies turned out great!

I think if there was more dough it would make sense to use a larger utensil than a fork, but this recipe was relatively small.","Any insights would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

Sure, here are some reasons why using a wooden spoon might have been suggested for this recipe:

* **Non-stick properties:** Wooden spoons are naturally non-stick, which can make it easier to mix and fold dough without sticking to the utensil. This can result in better-textured cookies with a lighter and more airy texture.


* **Even mixing:** The rounded shape of wooden spoons allows them to mix ingredients evenly without","Edit: The cookies were delicious, but I think this is the reason I'm asking.

"Why do English speakers rarely know a second language, but most of the world knows English as a second language?","# Answer
English speakers rarely know a second language due to a variety of factors, including the widespread use of English as a global lingua franca, the historical influence of English-speaking nations, and the accessibility of English language education in many parts of the world. The prevalence of English in international business, technology, science, and pop culture has made it a practical choice for many to learn, often at the expense of their native languages.","This is a question that has puzzled linguists and educators for many years.

Can you help me create a program in R that can generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 and store them in a vector?
To generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 in R, you can use the sample() function. Here's the algorithm to generate the random integers and store them in a vector:
1. Declare a vector variable to store the random integers.
2. Generate the random integers using the sample() function.
3. Store the generated random integers in the vector.
4. Display the vector to verify that the integers are stored correctly.
Here's the R code to implement the above algorithm:

Explain why in the center of mass frame of reference frame for two moving particles they both have the same energy,". This question is related to the concept of the center of mass (COM) frame in classical mechanics, which is a reference frame where the total momentum of a system of particles is zero.

In the center of mass frame, we consider the system of two particles, let's call them particle 1 and particle 2, with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and velocities \(\vec{v}_1\) and \(\vec{v}_2",".

In the center of mass frame of reference frame, the total kinetic energy of the two particles is equal, but the total momentum is zero. This is because the center of mass frame of reference frame is located at a point of equilibrium for the total momentum of the system, and this point is the same for the total kinetic energy.

Since the total kinetic energy is the same for the two particles, they have the same energy in the center of mass frame of reference frame."

"CMV: Resisting arrest should not be allowed as the solo criminal charge In March of this year, police officers in Sacramento arrested a man they misidentified as having a warrant out for his arrest. The arrest turned physical with an officer kicking the suspect while he was being compliant. Even though he was later confirmed to not have a warrant, the police charged him with a single count of resisting arrest.   Just earlier today, a disturbing video was made public that showed an officer from the Anderson Police using a recently banned ""chokehold restraint"" to arrest a man that was only eventually charged with resisting arrest.   Using this as a sole charge is often the byproduct of a police mistake or even an unjustified arrest. I believe that the charge is meant to deflect from police misconduct and place the blame on the defendant. It does not serve the interest of justice to use ""resisting arrest"" as a sole charge, especially if the arrest was a case of mistaken identity.","Instead, I suggest the following charges be considered:

1. Use of excessive force
2. Misuse of police power
3. Excessive detention
4. False identification
5. Resisting arrest after being read Miranda warnings

The focus should be on the actions of the police, not on the individual's resistance. This approach allows for a more accurate and just outcome, while still holding the police accountable for their actions.","I believe that resisting arrest should not be a criminal charge in cases where the arrest is based on a police mistake, or when the arrest was unjustified. I believe that the state should not be allowed to use resisting arrest as a criminal charge if the arrest was made on an unjustified basis.

death.

Roxana: Hey, thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I know we're both busy, but I wanted to talk to you about something important.
CEO: Of course, what's on your mind?
Roxana: I'm a shareholder in the company, and I'm concerned about the direction it's going in. Specifically, I'm worried about the level of risk the company is taking on.
CEO: Understandable. Can you give me some examples of what you're referring to?
Roxana: Well, for starters, I noticed that we've been investing a lot in new product development recently. And while I think it's important to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, I worry that we might be biting off more than we can chew financially. We could end up overstretched and end up losing money instead of making it.
CEO: Hmm...I see your point. But let me ask you this - why do you think shareholders should be worried about this? After all, isn't it our job as management to make decisions that are in the best interests of the company? And if we believe that investing in new products is the best way to grow the business and generate returns for shareholders, then isn't that what we should do?
Roxana: Well...I guess my concern is that shareholders could end up footing the bill if things go wrong with these new products. For example, if we invest a lot of money into developing a new product and it ends up being a flop, shareholders could lose a lot of money. And even if the product is successful but only marginally so, shareholders may not see much return on their investment either. So there's definitely potential downside here from a shareholder perspective.

"Ethics of Leaving a Job Very Early-On I am an electrical engineer that just recently graduated with my BS with a focus in industrial controls and automation. I took a position with a fairly large consulting company before the pandemic began back in December. My start date was then pushed from May to August because of the virus and a lack of work. However now that I have started I am becoming increasingly frustrated as I am being given very little guidance, receiving little to no communication (currently working from home), and very little meaningful work. I am becoming increasingly unsure about wether or not a company that treats a new hire in this way, even during this pandemic, is one that I want to be working for.   While sitting at my desk with literally nothing to do I began browsing LinkedIn and came across a very intriguing job opening from another company with whom I had a chance to work with on a project during a Co-op in school.

"How can you deny the existence of qualia? The existence of qualia seems like the most certain thing in the world. Even if the laptop I am seeing right now did not actually exist, it is nonetheless true that it seems to me, phenomenally, that there is a laptop in front of me. Even if solipsism were true, I myself would have qualia; it is just that no one else would.  But, if I am right, there are theories of mind such as behaviourism and eliminative materialism which deny the existence of qualia altogether. I do not understand how anyone could sensibly deny the existence of qualia.","**Answer:**

The passage is arguing that the existence of qualia is a matter of perspective, and that there is no objective evidence to support the claim that qualia exist. The passage points out that it is possible to have a subjective experience of something even if it is not objectively there. The passage also argues that there are theories of mind such as behaviorism and eliminative materialism that deny the existence of qualia altogether.","I am willing to grant my opponent the premise that qualia exist. I don't think I've ever met anyone who was willing to deny the existence of qualia. However, I don't see how denying the existence of qualia can be sensible.

"In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., ""sympathetic"" and ""stern"") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.
Example: Context word: upset.
Example solution: Sentence 1: PersonX yelled at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news. 
Sentence 2: PersonX comforted at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news.
Example explanation: As expected, two sentences contain mentions of PersonX and PersonY and they're quite similar. Their difference is in terms of trigger words (""yelled"" and ""comforted""), whcih result in them having different answers.

"CMV: The “Don’t Say Gay” bill does not discriminate against the LGBT community First, the bill is called “Florida House Bill 1557: Parental Rights in Education”.

"For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

There is a conspiracy theory right now that a perpetual motion machine exists and that govt. and corporations are depriving us from our free energy. How do you debunk this to someone brainwashed by these dumb youtube videos?,"1. **Explain the fundamental misunderstanding.**

The perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that operates on a principle that is impossible in the real world. It is a machine that can produce energy without any input of energy, which is impossible.

2. **Present real-world evidence.**

The concept of a perpetual motion machine—a device that can do work indefinitely without an energy source—is fundamentally flawed due to the laws of physics, specifically the first and second laws of thermodynamics. To debunk the conspiracy theory that claims a perpetual motion machine exists and is being suppressed, it's important to clarify these laws and their implications:

 Question: John's town used to have lots of water, back when there were only a few hundred people. However, now that the town holds several thousand people, the water availability is 
 Choices: A)scarce 
B)plentiful
Solution: scarce
Explanation: Based on the information given in the paragraph, population growth will make water more scarce, so that is the correct answer.

"[LOTR] Why was Frodo corrupted by the Ring? It's largely regarded that Frodo technically failed in his question to destroy the ring, for he would, if not for the intervention of Golum, put the ring on and did the same thing as Isildur. Obviously the ring itself is constantly trying to manipulate the wearer, and likely tried to goad their desires or interests for this. However, until that point, Frodo had been relatively unscathed with a few lapses here and there. What in the end drove Frodo to fail? What desires did he have that made him want to keep the ring?","Frodo's corruption by the Ring is a major plot point in J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings."" The Ring's influence on Frodo is multifaceted, and ultimately leads to his downfall and the fate of Middle-earth.

If the answer can be found in the passage, label it as ""span"". If the answer is a number, label as ""number"". Similarly, label ""date"" if you think the answer to the given question is a date.

Passage: Compared with its metropolitan area, the city of Houstons population has a higher proportion of minorities.

Can air conditioning gas or another gas be used to absorb heat to increase its pressure and then run a turbine or cylinder to generate electricity,"?

Yes, air conditioning gas, such as Freon 134a, can be used to absorb heat and increase its pressure to generate electricity. This is a widely used method in power plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels.","?

The concept you're referring to is similar to the principles behind combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants, but with a twist involving air conditioning (AC) refrigerant. In traditional power generation, the Rankine cycle is used in conjunction with a Brayton cycle (or a similar gas turbine cycle) to generate electricity.

"As part of the course you’ll take on 3 modules – Human Structure and Function (HSF), World of Microorganisms (WOM) and Molecular Basis of Life (MBL).
WOM and MBL are part of the School of Biological Sciences – in these modules you’ll be seated alongside Biologists, Zoologists, Medicinal Chemists and many others. These are also the bigger modules with 300 in each!
These modules have lectures on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In addition to this you’ll also sit a 3 hour lab once a week.
HSF happens on Tuesday and Thursday (so yes… you’ll be in everyday of the week). The class is a lot smaller – 115 people. The content here is pretty varied and you’ll have a mixture of lectures, practicals (anatomy and physiology) and tutorials.
As a whole the lecturers are very accessible. You can easily contact them by their email – either to get an answer to your question or arrange to meet with them if you’re have particular difficulty with something. You can just as easily approach them at the end of the lecture.
You are expected to work outside the lecture hours but how much or how little you do is up to you. They give you estimates for how long you should spend (we were told at the start we should expect 9-5 days) but work it into a schedule that suits you. I know from experience that going over a lecture can take me from 1 to 3 hours!
Almost all lecturers will also provide you with additional reading to go alongside the lecture – it’s great for learning more about a topic… especially if it’s an area you are specifically interested in.
All practicals are timetabled and are carried out in one of Queen's many labs. You’ll learn many techniques that are used in professional laboratories. They also give you the opportunity to visualise what you have been learning in lectures.
Tutorials are part of the HSF module. They provide an opportunity to apply what you have been learning in lectures to real life situations. I definitely find them challenging as sometimes the answer isn’t always clear so they’re a great opportunity to ask questions too.
They’re also great for interacting with the lecturer who’ll be able to guide the direction of your thoughts to help you answer the question.
Throughout the year you will sit a number of assessments across all three modules. The marks from the assessments are included in your final module mark. Assessments can take very different forms – computer multiple choice, written or group work!
In the case of WOM and MBL weekly labs also make up part of your final mark. At the end of the year you each module requires you to sit a written exam.
Once you’ve got through all this you’re more than ready for the weekend to come!

The crash on the A4 in Derry Hill at around 3am on August 16, in which a car crashed into a house and caught fire, resulted in the deaths of Ryan Nelson, 20, Corey Owen, 19, Matthew Parke, 19, and Jordan Rawlings, 20.

The funeral of Ryan Nelson will be held on Friday afternoon (September 18), with the cortege to drive through the Wiltshire town to allow mourners to pay their respects.

Family tributes to Ryan described him as a ""ray of sunshine"" who was ""loved by everyone"".

The moving tribute said: ""Ryan, our ray of sunshine. He lightened up everyone's life, a truly wonderful gentleman, so polite with lovely morals.

""Ryan worked in Tesco. He loved it there as he was with his friends. He was a massive football fan. He supported Aldershot Town FC and Manchester United. He was a very talented DJ, it was something he wished to pursue in the future.

""Ryan was loved by everyone. He has the most beautiful soul. So handsome, he loved all his designer gear, had so much pride. Our lives are empty without him.""

Floral tributes to all four victims were left by the side of the A4 in the aftermath of the crash as the local community honoured them.

The funeral procession will pass by Calne Town Hall at 2pm and will then proceed towards the Tesco store where Ryan worked.

There will be a celebration of Ryan's life after the service, but this is by invitation only to ensure it can be held safely at a Covid-secure venue.

The details of funerals of the other victims have not been disclosed at this time.

Anyone wanting to pay respects to the victims has been warned by police that they need to do so in line with social distancing rules and the newly-introduced 'rule of six' when lining the streets.

Inspector James Brain, from the Chippenham Area Community Policing Team, said the police and the local authority had been working closely with the family to allow them to celebrate Ryan's life in as safe a way as possible.

He said: ""We completely understand that those who knew and loved Ryan want to be able to come together to remember him and pay their last respects.

""However, his family have made it clear that they want to be able to do this in a safe way, which does not pose a risk to public health.

""The town will see four funerals over the coming weeks, and I know this period of mourning will be very difficult for those having to say goodbye to much-loved sons, brothers and friends.

Wiltshire Council has also reminded mourners of the need to pay their respects safely, while recognising this was a ""devastating time"" for all involved.

Terence Herbert, chief executive of Wiltshire Council, said: ""This is a devastating time for those involved and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the four young men who lost their lives in this tragic accident.

""Understandably the family and friends of Corey, Jordan, Matthew, and Ryan want to celebrate their lives. We are working closely with colleagues at the police to support them to do so safely and within the latest Government legislation.

""These are unprecedented times and we understand this is difficult for those grieving loved ones.""
