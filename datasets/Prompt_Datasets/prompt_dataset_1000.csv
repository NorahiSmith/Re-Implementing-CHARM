Magnetotactic bacteria from Pavilion Lake, British Columbia
Introduction
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) have been found in a variety of aquatic sediments such as marine environments, freshwater lakes and rivers, hot springs, and brackish waters all over the world . In these settings, MTB tend to reside in chemically stratified water or sediment at the oxic-anoxic interface. The common feature that is unique to all MTB is their ability to synthesize intracellular membrane-bound crystals of single domain magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4) . The magnetosomes provide a torque on the cells that passively aligns them with the Earth's geomagnetic field. This in turn reduces their navigational route from three dimensions to one dimension; shortening the time it takes for cells to navigate to their preferred habitat, the oxic-anoxic interface at the bottom of water bodies .

Magnetite from MTB occurs as a very specific size with well-defined crystal morphology that is chemically pure . Such minerals are preserved in the rock record as “magnetofossils,” which have been found in Mesozoic rocks, and may extend back as far as the pre-Cambrian . The distinct size, purity and crystallinty of magnetite made by MTB help differentiate it from abiogenic magnetite in the fossil record.

This study investigates uncultured MTB from Pavilion Lake, a deep, slightly alkaline, freshwater lake in British Columbia. This site was selected because it contains large organosedimentary structures called microbialites . Such structures abound in the fossil record back to nearly 3.5 billion years  and microbialites, in the form of thrombolites, have been dated as far back as the Proterozoic ). The MTB that we isolated from Pavilion Lake belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of the cells, and the size and shape of magnetosomes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of the magnetosomes. This is the first time MTB have been described from a microbialite-forming environment. This discovery could be of great value to others interested in potential life forms on other planets or the earliest forms of life on Earth as Pavilion Lake contains microbial fossils in the freshwater microbialites.

Soccer-Liverpool's Jordan Henderson named England's Footballer of the Year

Liverpool's Premier League title winning captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers' Association (FWA).

(Adds details)

By Simon Evans

July 24 (Reuters) - Liverpool's Premier League title winning
captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the
Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers'
Association (FWA).

Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester United's
Marcus Rashford and Liverpool pair Virgil van Dijk and Sadio
Mane made up the rest of the top five.

The 30-year-old Henderson has been central to Liverpool's
success under Juergen Klopp through his leadership and tireless
midfield work.

""As grateful as I am I don't feel like I can accept this on
my own. I don't feel like anything I've achieved this season or
in fact during my whole career has been done on my own,"" said
Henderson.

""I owe a lot to so many different people – but none more so
than my current team mates – who have just been incredible and
deserve this every bit as much as I do,"" he said.

Henderson has played in 30 of Liverpool's league matches so
far this season and scored four goals.

Two other Liverpool players - right back Trent
Alexander-Arnold and goalkeeper Alisson Becker - also received
votes.

""I accept it on behalf of this whole squad, because without
them I'm not in a position to be receiving this honour. These
lads have made me a better player – a better leader and a better
person,"" added Henderson.

""If anything I hope those who voted for me did so partly to
recognise the entire team's contribution.""

The Footballer of the Year trophy has been awarded since
1948 when Stanley Matthews was its first recipient.

"CMV: Sanders and Warren will beat Biden if (and only if) one drops out and runs as the other's vp NOW Assuming that Sanders and Warren are both ideology-driven candidates, running for the primary purpose of furthering their (mostly overlapping) agenda, they should form a running coalition in which one drops out to run as the other's running mate, thus giving them a fighting chance at one of them getting the nomination.  The number of progressive voters isn't large enough to beat Biden if Sanders and Warren split the vote, but almost certainly is if it is coalesced.  Currently, RCP has the following poll averages:  Nationally: Biden: 32.2 Sanders: 16.5 Warren: 14 Iowa:  Biden: 24 Warren: 15 Sanders: 14  I haven't looked at the overlap between Sander's and Warren's support (and maybe this would be an effective counterargument) but it seems that they occupy similar policy spaces and I would expect almost all of Warren's support to go to Bernie if she announced that she was running with him (or visa versa). It would almost tie them with Biden immediately, which we would expect given that roughly half of democratic voters identify as liberal and half moderate.  Furthermore, bringing one of the two candidates into the spotlight would allow progressive voters, volunteers, donors, media AND support organizations to focus their attention and resources on one of them. It would also activate and engage disenfranchised progressive constituents who are feeling discouraged about the current chances of either progressive candidate winning the race.  NOTE: I only intend to argue this from a strategic perspective. Really not trying to get into a debate about whether we should WANT any candidate to win, nor discuss the merits of different agendas."

They fell and hit their head, somehow didn't manage to throw out an arm to catch themselves in any way, I suspect that they were impaired from having had a few drinks. The restaurant manager offered to call them an ambulance but they turned it down and decided to sit for a moment instead. Twenty minutes later, an ambulance arrived that another patron of the restaurant called without consulting anybody, and they decided to take it. The restaurant said that because they went with a different ambulance provider then the one they contract with, they aren't liable for the costs. Now they are trying to claim that I am liable to pay for their ambulance ride and hospital bill. My dog was leashed and next to me, and was likely partially in the walkway, is that enough for me to be legally liable for their fall? Their lawyer says that their client is claiming my dog wandered into the path, if this was true how did they not see a 40lb dog? Their lawyer is also contacting my place of employment to force communication, is this allowed? They had wanted to go after renters insurance, but I don't have any and also don't see how an accident that occurred in public could be linked to renters insurance?"

"[Meta] Signing off as a mod Normally mods come and go without much fanfair, but I thought I'd take a moment to explain why I'm leaving as a mod and most likely the sub.  I've been part of this community for about 7 years now and watched it grow bigger. There have been some changes - some popular and some less so. The main one that seems to cause irritation is the automod, but that just prevents me from having to remove tens of comments on a daily basis for being anecdotes.   This is also an issue we get a lot of abuse over. Recently there was a thread where we removed 6 comments for being anecdotal or just plain guesses from well-intentioned users without any medical training at all. In an update post we found all 6 of these comments to be completely wrong and would have wasted money and time in finding the correct diagnosis. So yes, there is harm in these guesses and we remove them. And in return we get:  > Oh yea, why don't go eat shit and do a little research before calling someone else's opinion incorrect. And then go fuck yourself. Retard. Now go ahead and ban me because you are wrong like homeless bum.  Or   >I'm sorry but didnt it not address the concern? Your rules fucking Suck jam it up your ass. Go ahead and ban me I'm leaving anyway. Power tripping jaggoffs.  This is something I do in my spare time. I don't get paid. I do it to try to help, but people do not understand that we simply cannot diagnose things or tell them how to treat them online without seeing the animal, no matter how much we are called money grabbing assholes. The posts saying ""PLEASE HELP MY DOG IS DYING"" really aren't going to get resolved without a trip to the vet. If my dog showed the same signs I'd take him to the clinic to work him up. There are also plenty of posts where we offer advice without guessing at a diagnosis so I'm not going to bother addressing that ""what's the point of the sub"". You can argue that amongst yourselves.  I guess the TL:DR is that I'm fed up of the abuse for absolutely no reason, so now there is one less person here to offer advice. Just remember there is someone at the other end of the internet before you tell them to go fuck themselves, especially if they are a professional trying to help.  Have a nice day."

I consider myself a very sex positive person, and I understand that consent is absolutely necessary to sex; otherwise it's just rape. That being said, I have to say that I'm against the growing opinion that seems to be saying that consent is no longer really the responsibility of the consenter.  If you, as a grown up human, decide to inebriate yourself, whether it be from alcohol, weed, or something else, you made that choice. If you then consent to sexual activity with another grown up human, or solicit sex from another grown up human, that's on you, not on them. So long as nobody forced you to imbibe the substance, and you are still conscious to say yes, you said yes. It is not the responsibility of the other person to assess your level of sobriety.  _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please* ***read through our rules***. *If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which,* ***downvotes don't change views****!

"Company Said I would get a Promotion in 6 Months but Now Says No I joined on at a company that was starting a project I am very familiar with, so they hired me on at a good rate. They said the team would be expanding a lot and getting new members, which it has, and I would get a promotion to ""lead"" a group of 3-4 as we get larger and larger.  Fast forward to 6 months to when this was supposed to happen and my boss says doesn't look like he can do it because HR and ""I don't fit the list of requirements"", mostly meaning I haven't been in the position for 3 years.  Now, what nobody else knows, is that I recorded my interview where they told me I would get promoted at the 6 month mark. Now, I'm pretty sure that is illegal, but I literally have proof they told me (which they now deny, btw). Obviously, I don't want to show them because you can't legally record people w/o consent. How should I go about this?"

"CMV: There are no negative effects because of the overall decline of spirituality in the world With the decline with religiosity usually comes with a decline in spirituality because the two are usually linked. I think that spirituality whether it is linked to religion or not is going away.  From what I can see, seems like people going on with their lives, participating in hobbies and such without any thought for spiritual things seems to be getting along just fine.  For the sake of argument, we can use this definition of spirituality. Feel free to modify it slightly if you want in your rebuttal. I'm not an expert on spiritual things as a disclaimer.  ""non-religious practices that help people get in touch with their spiritual selves through quiet reflection, time in nature, private prayer, yoga, or meditation.""  Now, I wouldn't be surprised if there are benefits to yoga or meditation, but the aren't just purely spiritual. I think they can have benefits if you do those things in a way that is devoid of anything spiritual and is purely secular.  I can't see a provable benefit to believing in spirits, life forces, an after life and a higher power and stuff."

"CMV: Democrat Leaders Extending the Patriot Act Shows Their Animosity Towards Trump is Mostly Rhetoric Of course, most people are aware of the impeachment hearings against Trump. However, just yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to fund and extend the Patriot Act for an extended 3 months after December 20th.   It seems to me hypocritical to believe that Trump is unfit for office and abused his power and then proceeds to potentially give him more power--or at least extending the duration of his current powers.   Additionally, Representative Justin Amash attempted to amend the budget bill by removing the Patriot Act language but the amendment was blocked by the Democrats on the Rules Committee. Only 10 Democrats voted against the resolution, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Tlaib.   The Trump administration still retains authority to reinitiate the NSA call records program, the program where millions of innocent American calls had been collected, if they deem it necessary.   Given the fact that the Trump administration could potentially extend another 4 years, it seems questionable at best why Democrats would not strip him of some of the powers he could abuse when they had the opportunity to. Given this, it seems to me most of the rhetoric against Trump is just for show. When presented with something to act on, most of the Democrats chose to empower Trump, and allow his administration the power to listen and collect calls, information, and data on millions of Americans."

"How NOT to Sell Myself Short with Salary I work as an RF Designer at a defense company in Los Angeles.  I've been fortunate enough to secure an interview with a tech company in the Bay Area (Cupertino). I've always wanted to work in tech so this is a great opportunity.  I currently make $102K with ~3.5 YOE.  The topic of compensation might come up and I want to be prepared just in case, but I honestly have no idea how to approach this for a couple of reasons:  1. It's a big CoL adjustment and I'm not sure how to accurately translate my salary. I've looked at two calculators for the area where I'd be working. One says $170K and another says $240K. I guess I could average these...? This just seems sooo high.   I've looked on a couple salary websites trying to compare against similar roles and experience levels. I think levels.fyi is probably the most accurate.  The salaries are submitted anonymously and they verify them with offer letters, W2s, etc. When I narrow it down to hardware positions at this company I'm seeing salaries that range from $135K to 200K+.  2. RF is very niche and I feel like the market for it is on fire right now. I get bombarded with messages/calls almost daily asking if I'd be willing to discuss a potential job opportunity. I also have two things in my favor: the job I'm applying for has been listed for a few months and I'm currently employed. This feels like a good place to negotiate from.  3. This one is more psychological and something I just need to get over. If compensation does come up its going to feel weird discussing a salary thats A LOT higher than what I currently make. It feels like I'd be negotiating for more Monopoly money. I already undervalue myself and I don't want to move jobs and cities to essentially take a paycut.  My fear is that I'll lowball my salary expectation because I have my current salary and CoL as a frame of reference.   Can anyone who has gone through a similar situation impart some wisdom for me here?  And...it's totally possible, hell even likely, I don't get an offer and this post is moot. I still appreciate the information because this probably won't be the last time I'm confronted with a situation like this. I just like to be prepared."

KIID (1470 AM) is a radio station licensed to Sacramento, California, United States. The station is owned by Punjabi American Media LLC.

It is simulcast with 1450 AM KOBO (Yuba City), KWRU 1300 AM (Fresno) and KLHC 1350 AM (Bakersfield).

History

KXOA
Lincoln Dellar put KXOA on the air in 1945 at 1490 kHz, alongside an FM outlet at 107.9 MHz. KXOA, Sacramento's fourth radio station, broadcast with 250 watts and was an affiliate of the Don Lee Network and Mutual Broadcasting System. Dellar sold the station in 1946 to Sacramento Broadcasters; the new owners were approved to relocate the station to 1470 kHz with 1,000 watts in 1948. Cal-Val Radio acquired KXOA in 1958 and increased the station's power to 5,000 watts during the day in 1960.

In the late 1950s, KXOA switched to a Top 40 format, fiercely competing with KROY (1240 AM) once that station flipped to the format in 1960. A young Don Imus was hired away from Stockton station KJOY in 1970 to do morning drive; he quickly left for Cleveland's WGAR. In May 1970, KXOA changed its format to a blend of Adult Contemporary and Oldies, with the slogan of ""Let the Sound Shine In.""  KXOA-AM-FM were sold to separate owners at the end of 1970, and while the FM station kept the call letters, the AM station, sold to Mediacast, Inc., had to change and became KNDE, changing its format to progressive rock. 1470 AM was sold back to KXOA-FM, Inc., in 1978, and regained its KXOA call letters as a result. By 1980, KXOA had moved to oldies as ""14K"", and in 1982, it began broadcasting the Music of Your Life syndicated format. The station changed to business news in 1988 and then returned to oldies in 1990 as ""Cruisin 1470"".

Changes and sale to Radio Disney
On April 15, 1997, the callsign was changed to KQPT; on July 16, 1998 to KOME; on January 15, 1999 to KRAK; and finally on February 19, 2001 to the current KIID, along with the sale to The Walt Disney Company and switch to the Radio Disney format (after a period of simulcasting then-sister KNCI that began on October 16, 2000).

On July 15, 2009, two of the three radio towers KIID broadcasts from were destroyed due to a fire at the transmitter site. Towers 1 (center) and 2 (eastern) were destroyed. All three towers were replaced by towers of shorter height. This replacement allowed the licensee to petition for eliminating the requirement for painting and lighting the towers.

Sale to Punjabi American Media
On August 13, 2014, Disney put KIID and twenty-two other Radio Disney stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. Disney originally planned to temporarily shut down the station on September 26, 2014. However, will remain on the air and continue carrying Radio Disney programming until it is sold.

On June 29, 2015, Radio Disney Sacramento filed an application to sell KIID to Punjabi American Media. It was approved by the FCC on August 26, 2015. The sale was completed on September 25, 2015, at a purchase price of $800,000.

""Yes, but were too far out for me to contact them.""

""Tony can you control your guns under the bridge from here?""

""Sure, no problem.""

""The guns we installed have the best bullets fired per second ratio of any machine gun made. They'll put a bullet in every square inch of a football field in under ten seconds. Let's see what they'll do to a boat filled with C4.""

I watched the camera from behind Tony as he used the guidance system on the guns and opened fire. It's hard to describe what that many bullets hitting the water in a constant flow looks like. I guess it most compared to the trail a jet boat leaves in the water going at top speed. The trail of spray was high and fast in the water as Tony guided the spray of screaming ammo at the oncoming boats.

Q: I know that the answer to the question ""According to Atwood, the Polish people found a source of strength in what?"" is in ""A reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: ""Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World ... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom.

"Do I really even want my PE? I’ve been working as an EE for over three years, and I’m getting to the point where all of my coworkers/supervisor are really pushing for me to get my PE. But the truth is, I don’t even want it.   When I look at their jobs and the stress that comes with it, I’m asking myself, why would I ever want that? I don’t have kids, I don’t need the money, I don’t have any desire to climb the ladder, and I definitely don’t need the constant bombardment that seems to follow. I have a low stress, non-management position and I would like to keep it that way.   I enjoy engineering, but I just want to do my designs, work on some programming, and then go home. I don’t want anything to do with work until the next day, and that just doesn’t seem possible once I get my PE (and promoted). Becoming the technical lead on projects sounds dreadful to me. Checking emails until I go to sleep, or being on-call is not my idea of a good time and they can keep the extra pay.   Anyways, just ranting, but If anyone has been in a similar position or if you never got your PE and you work in an industry where the PE is abundant, how did that work out for you?"
"Every time I publish with Elsevier a small part of me dies I now have three papers in various Elsevier journals. Through publication of each of these I have grown to dispise Elsevier more and more.   I hate they way that they are providing less and less at each stage of the publication process. For example I wrote the paper, my colleagues peer-reviewed it, and then now I even have to do the type setting myself. It makes me question what exactly Elsevier are providing besides a shell to conduct peer review and a hosting platform afterwards?  Although there are many issues generally with the publication process, it is the authors doing type setting that actually bugs me the most. For those of you that have not used the Elsevier type setting online tool, this is an interactive document editor where you generate your own proofs. All content is editable and therefore undermining the peer review process. For example, at this stage for key points could be changed or countless self citations added. After this you hit submit and it's done. Now they will claim that this process has some editorial oversight but in my experience it does not. It's a joke.   Also I hate the way they refer to us as customers. Working with a publisher should be a collaborative process. I am planning to avoid Elsevier journals in the future when I have a say in where a paper goes."

Last month, an op–ed in The New York Times argued that high-protein and high-fat diets are to blame for America’s ever-growing waistline and incidence of chronic disease. The author, Dean Ornish, founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute, is no newcomer to these nutrition debates. For 37 years he has been touting the benefits of very low-fat, high-carbohydrate, vegetarian diets for preventing and reversing heart disease. But the research he cites to back up his op–ed claims is tenuous at best. Nutrition is complex but there is little evidence our country’s worsening metabolic ills are the fault of protein or fat. If anything, our attempts to eat less fat in recent decades have made things worse.

Ornish begins his piece with a misleading statistic. Despite being told to eat less fat, he says, Americans have been doing the opposite: They have “actually consumed 67 percent more added fat, 39 percent more sugar and 41 percent more meat in 2000 than they had in 1950 and 24.5 percent more calories than they had in 1970.” Yes, Americans have been eating more fat, sugar and meat, but we have also been eating more vegetables and fruits (pdf)—because we have been eating more of everything.

What’s more relevant to the discussion is this fact: During the time in which the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. nearly tripled, the percentage of calories Americans consumed from protein and fat actually dropped whereas the percentage of calories Americans ingested from carbohydrates—one of the nutrient groups Ornish says we should eat more of—increased. Could it be that our attempts to reduce fat have in fact been part of the problem? Some scientists think so. “I believe the low-fat message promoted the obesity epidemic,” says Lyn Steffen, a nutritional epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. That’s in part because when we cut out fat, we began eating foods that were worse for us.

"I believe that there is literally no reason to believe in any of the traditional religions of humanity. CMV. Disclaimer:  I'm not one of those assholes that goes around telling people that they're wrong about their religion, and I can kind of see how some people might be SPIRITUAL and maybe believe that there needed to be some kind of intelligent being to set the universe in motion (that's not my opinion, but that's an at least SOMEWHAT understandable view to take), but...   I just cannot see why a rational, intelligent person would believe in any of the traditional religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.  There are so many lines of thought you can follow to reach the conclusion that they're false:  Why would a God or gods single out a certain group of His (or their) beloved children as worthy of knowing the one true path, while not including the rest of His (or their) billions of creations?  Clearly they would see how that would lead to conflict within human society.    Why would an entire universe unimaginably gigantic universe have to be created 13.7 billion years ago to accommodate one little planet with one little race of intelligent beings?  Alternatively, if you believe the world WASN'T created 13.7 billion years ago and that it is much younger, why would a god intentionally mislead his creations by making tons of evidence point to that conclusion?  Of course, there are a lot more things that I could say, but you get the gist.  I believe that the only reason someone would believe in any of the organized religions is indoctrination or ignorance.  Change my view, please.  P.S. Apologies if this is badly worded or not very coherent."

With his laughing mood snuffed suddenly, Max ground his teeth for a moment. He glanced up at Patricia, who'd been listening to the one-sided conversation the whole time and seemed to be watching him closely now.

""Crystal,"" he said as his and Patricia's eyes locked.

""Good. Eat your pizza and get your ass out of there, before you do something I can guarantee you'll regret.""

As soon as he hung up, Patricia hit him up. ""So, what was he making sure you were _crystal_ clear about?""

Surprised by this, Max peered at her, wondering if maybe the volume on his phone was too loud and she'd heard Moe. But she shrugged. ""Unless you were talking about a girl named Crystal, typically the one-word response would be because someone was asking if you were clear about something?""

""Is that right? Wow."" Max smiled at her. ""That's _exactly_ what he asked.""

Patricia smiled. ""Don't look so impressed, Max. Like _My Cousin Vinny_ there are several courthouse dramas in particular I've seen often, and _A Few Good Men_ just so happens to be one of the most quoted movies of all time. Not the part where Colonel Jessep demands certainty that Kaffee is clear about his pompous rant. But I've seen the movie enough times that it's the first thing that comes to mind when I hear someone ask or say they're _crystal_ clear. Anyway, it was pretty obvious just from hearing your end of that conversation. Was he making sure you're clear about not getting any ideas again?""

""Yeah."" Max nodded, keeping to himself how sure Moe sounded when he said she's still hung up on her ex. ""Guess he's worried I might do something stupid that Izzy would be upset about. But we both know that's out of the question . . . _right_?""

There's a large population of Spanish-speakers in my area, but most of them speak Spanish *and* English.  At my job, though, I have at least three coworkers who speak pretty much no English. It's frustrating trying to communicate with them sometimes, and this is even though I do know how to say some things in Spanish, and that I'm willing to look things  up on a translator site before talking to them if I need to. But if it wasn't for those things, I'd never be able to talk to them without a bilingual coworker to translate.  My general manager speaks no Spanish, so any time he needs to talk one-on-one with them, he has to have someone translate, which, among other things, presents a privacy issue. He can't have a conversation with them that's private and only between the two of them. There has to be a third party who knows what he's saying, which could be something personal or private.  The guests also struggle to communicate with them sometimes, and they don't have the luxury of being in front of a computer all day like me in case they want to look something up real quick (which I think most people won't do anyway).  I understand that people need jobs and you don't want to turn someone away who's otherwise a good worker because of the language barrier, but it just doesn't seem to work. It's more trouble than it's worth. We have to always have someone working who's bilingual if any of my non-English-speaking coworkers are in, and if we don't, communication is almost impossible."

Q: Question: Were the three films that Usher starred in while pursuing an acting career directed by the same person? Passage:Live was released to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his second and third studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 15 and 16, 1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, ""I really like the sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't get a chance to see the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well."" Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—""Don't Be Cruel"", ""Every Little Step"", ""Rock Wit'cha"" and ""Roni""—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' ""Tender Love"" and LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"".

"CMV: Donald Trump ran for president purely to bolster his ego, and despite his anti-establishment rhetoric, his presidency will not be much different than a typical Republican Presidency In his campaign, Donald Trump gained wide support from the disenfranchised, white working class in the central United States. He promised to bring back jobs, tear apart free trade deals, and to drain the so-called swamp.   However, he has already gone back on a number of issues- he's no longer aggressively going after Hillary Clinton after proclaiming that he would ""lock her up"", and appointed a plethora of establishment republicans to key roles in his presidency. Former RNC chairs and speakers of the house are in his staff, the embodiment of the establishment. How can he present himself as an ant-establishment President when he picks the establishment for his cabinet and key roles in the White House?   As far as his ego goes, I don't see any other reason why he would want to run. He wants the prestige of president, but without sweeping ideological changes. He has demonstrated that he will not ""drain the swamp"", and has already backtracked on his views of ObamaCare, softened his view on NAFTA and relaxed his radical views on Climate Change.   Quite frankly, I don't think he has the experience to make sweeping changes himself, and his choice of cabinet members prove that he'll defer to them for advice. As a man that is so enamoured with his image, it is safe to say that he only ran to bolster his ego."

MCU Earth has been going through this for years at this point.

"Looking for a batter that frys so crisp that it's practically shattering when bitten into. My wife and I have a favorite little korean fried chicken place called Bonchon, they've got the most crispy wings we've ever had - they almost shatter when you bite into them. The batter is somewhat transparent, very thin, very crispy and crunchy, almost like biting into glass (if that makes sense).  I've experimented quite a bit to replicate this batter and cannot get it right, can anyone share some insight onto this?  Thus far, I've tried different ratios of rice flour and AP flour, dredge, no dredge, various ratios of water and vodka, frying non-stop til golden brown, frying blonde resting then frying a second time to gold, rice flour alone, rice flour mixed with corn-starch, drying the wings overnight beforehand, brining and not, different oil temps, corn-starch alone, extra wet batter, extra thick batter, dredging dry; I've run out of ideas.  As best as I can explain it, it's almost like eating a thin layer of hard-candy that's not candy. Ridiculously crispy and thin membrane surrounding the chicken. We've tried well over a dozen times and although the end results have been good, it's not what we're after - any insight would be super helpful!"

"CMV: Criticism should be reserved for those with knowledge and or experience I don’t know anything about art, but I can say if I like or dislike something. I can even go as far as say why I do or don’t like it. I can’t tell the artist why their art sucks, I’m not qualified to do so. Until I can produce something of similar or greater quality I lack the credentials to criticize their work. Personal example: I race cars competitively. I’m a great driver, on the road and on the track. This comes from knowledge, studying, and experience. When I criticize someone’s driving, I’m doing so by analyzing the other person’s performance in front of me, so that I have first hand experience of their driving. I would be able to criticize specific elements, instead of saying something like, “that was a shitty left turn.” I would say something like, “you missed the apex by 3 feet, your entry speed was too fast, and your turn in was too late.”"
"Help with Underperforming Intern I have several years experience dealing with summer interns and thought I was pretty good at it. I pride myself at running an internship program that is both paid and adheres to the ""no coffee/no copies"" policy (e.g., provides useful job training and acquisition of skills that can be used going forward).  I've hired a few interns at the company and helped many more find the right job for them in the field.  &#x200B;  Until this summer.  Of the four interns, three are amazing.  The last one, however, is struggling.  He cannot work at all independently, is sloppy, and doesn't follow basic workplace rules. I started off managing him the way that I managed others, but he produced work riddled with mistakes and never asked questions, even when given multiple opportunities to clarify.  He has twice called out last minute (and two additional times not shown up at all), frequently comes in 90+ minutes late, and almost always leaves 30 minutes early and takes lunches longer than an hour.  I have changed my management style with him as much as possible (twice/day meetings, double checking all his work at multiple stages of the process, and refusing to approve his time card until he amends it to reflect the actual hours he worked, not the 9-5 he claims).  I have also spoken with him about proper attendance, proper use of a shared office (he decorated every available wall and table space and doesn't really understand he is sharing an office with other people who might want to use it), and about proper email communication.  &#x200B;  Two weeks ago, after adding up my time dealing with him (and the direct consequences of him flaking, angering others or producing sub--par work), I realized that I spent \~20 hours of my time. The work product he produced is probably less than two hours of what I could do with these tasks, so I was out 18 hours (and had to work the weekend to get my job done). Last week, after he arrived two hours late (he missed our scheduled 9:15 meeting and I was currently in another meeting), the office manager put him to work scanning old files for digital record keeping. With some supervision from her, he was able to do a pretty decent job.  We decided that he would try this for a week, and it turned out that he was able to scan with only 1 or 2 errors.  &#x200B;  I planned to use this for the rest of the summer, but as soon as he walked in the door Monday (around 10:45), he was in my office complaining how the other interns get better projects.  He said he didn't like the first projects he was assigned and accused me of unfair treatment.  I indicated that I had to revise the tasks because of all the problems that happened in the first few weeks. He then threatened to get his university internship office involved as I wasn't providing job skill development. He didn't show up today and both members of our HR department are on vacation. My boss suggested firing him, but I am unsure whether that is even possible with this internship. As things stand, it has made trouble for other employees, other interns, and is keeping me from getting my work done.  &#x200B;  I have paperwork. I have written documentation for things when I have noticed them (Call-outs, ghosting, coming in really late, and written records of some of the unusable products he submitted). I know one of our interns complained to HR about shared spaces, and I think one employee also complained because he was constantly bothering her instead of doing any work. However, I don't readily know how to get access to these before July 8th.  &#x200B;  Any advice?  Thanks so much for any help!  &#x200B;  Edit: Location = CA"

"I'm going to study engineering but Computer or Mechanical?  Hello everyone! Please help me! I'm stuck in thinking about the major I should attend. For computer engineering: My cousins encouraged me to follow the path of Programmation and software for the job opportunities available there and for the major growth too. For mechanical engineering: I have been just in love with mechanical lessons from my high school. I was so far getting the highest scores among my fellows in these lessons, but the job opportunities and the major growth are low as well as the high competition: even some mechanical engineers (close contacts) are working in trade rather than working in their field: That's disturbing!!!!! any help?    Ps: do you recommend aerospace engineering rather than both of them?"

"Read this for context:
""The body is whole and it is here. Yes, of course I can."" She studied Ma Bichette's face and frowned.

""What? What's wrong?"" I asked, afraid that there was something wrong. I mean, other than the obvious.

""I can still do it,"" she said. ""Follow me.""

I followed her for what must have been hours. Never once did her feet leave dry ground, she expertly knew her way through the winding swamp. I said nothing. My arms were beginning to ache from carrying her for so long. Finally, we reached our destination.

A stone house. It was not what I was expecting. I am not sure what it was I was expecting. A ruined wooden shack, perhaps, or something even more archaic, like a thatched roof earthen hut. But it was a neatly built small house of rounded stones. I followed her into the house. Boxes and baskets and bottles filled dozen of shelves and tabletops. The sorceress pointed to a conspicuously empty table. ""Here.""

I carefully laid Ma Bichette on it.

The sorceress came up from behind me with a fine crystal glass. In it was an amber liquid which to this day I have never tasted the likes of. ""You look like you could use a drink,"" she said. I obediently drank it. It was both fiery and sweet and I could feel it slide down my throat as the sorceress rummaged about in a chest at the end of the table that Ma Bichette was lying on.

I leaned against the wall. ""Do you have a name?""

""Why wouldn't I?""

_Well, because you're a witch,_ I thought.

She laughed from across the room. ""Witches have names too. Alava, you can call me, if you want to call me something other than witch.""

Having my mind read like a book would have bothered me before but now it was comforting. At least she was a real witch.

Alava opened up a small leather bag and pulled out a handful of worn and polished bones. They looked like human finger bones. Again, had Ma Bichette's corpse not been lying before me I would have been worried. Alava tossed the bones on the table next to her, examined the bones, and then repeated the action twice more.

""There has been a misfortune,"" she said and turned to me.

I hadn't eaten since lunch and my head was swirling with my particular madness and whatever liquor Alava had given me. ""I know. She's dead.""

""That is not it.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.  The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.  Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.  Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.  He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further).   I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?  I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.  I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.  Do I need to take this seriously, or can I start coming up with more ways to say pound sand? What should I do if he does try to take further action?"

Momemtum growing for dementia-friendly Arran

A bid to make Arran Scotland's first-dementia friendly island has taken the first steps towards becoming a reality, with a second big push being held next week.

The idea was first reported by the Banner in May after being raised by Councillor Jimmy Miller, the older people's champion for North Ayrshire Council.

In order to take the matter forward a meeting was held at the Ormidale Pavilion in Brodick last month, when Donna Paterson, the local Alzheimer Scotland coordinator, was invited to provide more information and met with 18 interested people from a variety of backgrounds. The strong feeling of the meeting was that the time was right to try to establish Dementia Friendly Arran.

The group will meet again on Tuesday August 21 at 11.30am at the Ormidale Pavilion with the aim of creating a steering group who will take the work forward. The group would be keen to have the involvement of anyone interested and in particular representation from those caring for someone living with dementia.

Colin Adams, the social services team manager for Arran said: 'Given the demographic of Arran and the number of people on the island that are affected, considering ways in which people living with dementia could be supported is something that our Health and Social Care Partnership along various volunteer groups have been working on for some time.

'However, encouraging, informing and involving the whole community to be more mindful and participative in making the lives of our residents and visitors who are living with dementia that bit easier would obviously make a greater impact and has got to be a goal worth pursuing.'

The concept of a dementia-friendly community is not new – as far back as 2001, Alzheimer Scotland's Dementia Awareness Week focused on how to reduce stigma, raise awareness and create more dementia-friendly communities. But it's probably fair to say that the dementia-friendly movement was given a huge boost in March 2012 by the Prime Minister's Challenge on Dementia south of the border. The attention this achieved gave an added impetus to some of the work which had been going on quietly for many years, with more and more communities coming forward to say they too wanted to get involved.

Alzheimer Scotland has been working to encourage the creation of dementia friendly communities across the country to achieve just that. On their website they describe how this works: 'A dementia friendly community is made up of the whole community – shop assistants, public service workers, faith groups, businesses, police, fire and ambulance staff, bus drivers, school pupils, clubs and societies, and community leaders – people who are committed to working together and helping people with dementia to remain a part of their community and not become apart from it.

'This involves learning a little about dementia and doing very simple and practical things that can make an enormous difference to people living with the condition.'

"I don’t know how to treat this pic I’m 18 years old male, and in the U.S. Navy. I went to medical to get a mole checked out, since it was being weird. It started feeling like a scab, and got a little bigger. Well, let’s just say that medical in the navy, or at least on my base, isn’t amazing. They said it showed all of the signs of being cancerous, but they couldn’t be sure so they wanted to send a sample in to a lab to get it verified. So the procedure they did was numb the area, put iodine on it, and take a razor blade and slice off the top layer of skin where the mole was, and then put silver nitrate in the wound. They cut pretty deep, and took quite a bit of skin. They gave me no bandages or anything, just said to apply Vaseline and a bandaid once or twice a day. That was yesterday morning. Since then it’s turned a weird grayish brown, and hasn’t stopped stinging. The surrounding area is stained from the iodine, that’s why it’s brown. It hurts all the way down to my wrist. I have no idea if it will heal, or if this silver nitrate is still in there and needs to be washed out or something, and it’s becoming very concerning to me. Any advice is much appreciated."

I’m trying to help my elderly mum find a food she had as a child that she hasn’t come across for 60+ years.  For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.  She has described it as a raw chocholate that was white/off-white in colour that came in shards/chucks with a crunchy honeycomb like texture but was drier and did not dissolve like honeycomb does. It was very sweet and she thinks it tastes like chocolate.  I bought some organic cocoa butter as she saw a picture and thought it looked similar but perhaps was a bit darker. It also wasn’t sweet at all and she said the texture of the cocoa butter was creamy whereas the mystery item was crunchy.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_butter  Any ideas what this might have been? I imagine that this food would have been something transported in bulk during the war. Perhaps a type of raw sugar? I’m really keen to help her relive an obviously strong memory of her childhood.  Any ideas?"

"Auto-encoder for image reconstruction
In this problem, you will design a convolutional auto-encoder network for image reconstruction. You will use the CIFAR10 dataset for training and testing. Note that Pytorch has
pre-defined data loader for CIFAR10. The input to the auto-encoder will be an image and
you will try to reconstruct the same image as output. You will design just a two block
encoder and a two block decoder. Effectively, your auto-encoder will thus have four convolutional layers. Note that the convolutional layers in decoder will actually be transpose
convolution layers. For all these layers, use a kernel size of 3, stride of 1 and padding of
0. The number of channels in the auto-encoder should be of the following order: (input
channels, output channels) ==> (3,8), (8,8), (8,8), (8,3). For example, the first layer has
an input channels of 3 and output channels of 8. The second layer has an input channel size
of 8 and output channel size of 8 and so on. Make sure to use a suitable activation function
at required places. Use the L2 loss function.
1. Plot the convergence of the loss function.
2. Test if the auto-encoder works on the CIFAR10 test set. Visualize 10 inputs with
their corresponding 10 reconstructions."

Cause I have this small bowl of gross, snot like bone ooze. I tasted a small morsel and it was honestly quite delicious. Dark, rich and almost butter like with a familiar marrow-y flavor.  Can I eat this? I feel like I should it this. How would I prepare it in a tasty way? My first thought was to just chill it as is and spread it on a toasted baguette or something. Thanks a million for any help or suggestions!!"
"As the detective stepped into the abandoned mansion, her pulse quickened with anticipation. The creaky floorboards beneath her boots added to the sense of unease. The mansion had always intrigued her, with its intricate architecture and eerie silence. As she scanned the hallway, her eyes were drawn to a cryptic message etched into the wall. ""The key to the truth lies within,"" it read. The detective's determination to uncover the mansion's secrets was stronger than ever.
A sudden clap of thunder made her jump. The storm outside was growing more intense by the minute. She had to work quickly before the mansion was engulfed in darkness. With a deep breath, the detective ascended the spiral staircase, each step groaning beneath her weight. She reached the top and gasped at the sight before her.
The room was filled with ancient artifacts and cobweb-covered furniture. In the center of the room stood a dusty old chest. As the detective approached it, she felt a sense of foreboding wash over her. She hesitated, but her curiosity got the better of her. She lifted the lid and recoiled in horror as a swarm of bats flew out, screeching into the night sky.
Despite the obstacle, the detective remained undeterred. She knew the truth was within reach. With a steady hand, she rummaged through the contents of the chest. Finally, she found it – a map to the hidden chamber beneath the mansion. The detective's motivation to uncover the truth had been renewed. She set off towards the secret chamber, determined to solve the mystery once and for all."

<start of reference>
Chronic egg laying  is a maladaptive, behavioural disorder commonly seen in pet birds which repeatedly lay clutches of infertile eggs in the absence of a mate. It is particularly common in cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, macaws and amazon parrots. Birds exhibiting chronic egg laying behavior will frequently lay eggs one after the other without stopping to brood them once the typical clutch size for their particular species has been reached. Excessive egg laying places a strain on the hen's body, depleting resources such as calcium, protein and vitamins from her body and may lead to conditions such as egg binding, osteoporosis, seizures, prolapse of the oviduct or peritonitis - which may lead to her death.

Causes
While a single specific cause is unknown, chronic egg laying is believed to be triggered by hormonal imbalances influenced by a series of external factors. As in the domestic chicken, female parrots are capable of producing eggs without the involvement of a male - it is a biological process that may be triggered by environmental cues such as day length (days becoming longer, indicating the arrival of spring) and food availability, or the presence of a dark, enclosed space (such as a cupboard or space beneath furniture) in which the bird in question can hide and is not a conscious decision. An overabundance of easily available, nutritious food may trigger the bird's reproductive cycle, as can the presence of a male bird in the vicinity of her cage, or even a circumstance where the hen becomes mistakenly attracted to a mirror or other cage toy. Removing the eggs from a bird demonstrating this behavior may make the problem worse by inducing her to lay even more eggs.

Treatment
Unlike cats, dogs and other pet mammals, parrots are not routinely neutered. While it is possible to spay a female parrot, it is a difficult and dangerous procedure that is seldom performed except in extreme circumstances. Instead, treatment and prevention of chronic egg laying behavior involves behavioral modification and environmental changes.

Such changes may include:

Shortening the parrot's perceived day length by putting her to bed early
Denying her access to dark, enclosed spaces
Separating her from any birds to which she appears to be bonded in a sexual manner
Discouraging sexual behaviors from the bird towards humans or favored objects
Regularly changing around the layout of her cage
Permitting the bird to continue sitting on her eggs until she loses interest if she has already laid a clutch and then stopped

Hormonal treatment, such as injection of leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or a deslorelin implant placed beneath the skin may cause the egg-laying to cease, but does not resolve the underlying cause of the behavior.

"CMV: Money does buy happiness. The term ""money can't buy happiness"" is, I think, false, mainly now within the past years.   Let's give a scenario: you graduated college, got a decent $50k a year job and you live with your SO who makes around the same. Uh oh, student loans from college start to haunt you now, as well as car insurance, debt, mortgage, and maybe a dozen other things piling on top of that. Really the only way that you could ""fix"" this is by paying for it with money.   And let's say that they somehow get a lot of money. And let's say they live in a world where there isn't really a tax or anything (think simple). They pay off all their debts and ironically all their money from that was the exact amount to pay everything off. They live much happier than before.   And now you see how money buys happiness. It's true. Money does buy happiness. There are so many situations where money will solve your problems. I'm not trying to say how it's the only cause of happiness: there are things that can make people happy without the use of money, but generally if you have money it'll make you happier. I know that many people with tons of money are also depressed, but when you get a middle aged mid income family paying off all their debts and still being mid income, they are happy. Why? Because money.  ---  > *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday.
Sent 2: The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center.
Sent 3: A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported.
Sent 4: The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash.
Sent 5: But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported.
Sent 6: Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash.
Sent 7: The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people.
Sent 8: The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt.
Sent 9: Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.
Sent 10: Many of the bodies were badly charred from the fire, and authorities have used DNA samples to carry out numerous identifications.

Demetrius: I just feel so frustrated. I can't seem to focus on anything.

Demetrius: I don't know. It just feels like everything is a struggle right now. I can't seem to get my act together no matter how hard I try.
Coach: Okay, well let's focus on one thing at a time then. What is the most pressing issue that you're dealing with right now?
Demetrius: I guess it would be my work situation. I'm just having a hard time getting motivated to work on anything lately.
Coach: Alright, well why don't we start there then? What specifically about your work is causing you difficulty?
Demetrius: I don't know... it just feels like everything is pointless and that I'll never get ahead no matter how hard I try.
Coach: Okay, well those are some big feelings to tackle. But let's break it down and see if we can find some specific issues to address. Are you unhappy with your current job?
Demetrius: Yeah, I guess you could say that. I'm just not passionate about what I'm doing anymore and it feels like my career is going nowhere.
Coach: Okay, so it sounds like you may need to explore some other options then if you're not happy with your current situation. Have you been considering any other jobs or career paths?
Demetrius: No, not really...I've just been feeling stuck lately and haven't really known what else to do..
Coach: Well sometimes when we feel stuck in our careers, it helps to talk to someone who can give us some impartial advice or help us brainstorm some new ideas. Have you ever considered talking to a career counselor or taking some kind of assessment test to help figure out what direction you might want to go in next?
Demetrius: No, not really...I'm not sure if that would even help at this point...I feel like I've already tried everything and nothing has worked out so far..
Coach: Well sometimes when we feel like we've tried everything and nothing has worked out, it means that we need to change our approach or try something new altogether . So maybe talking to a career counselor or taking an assessment test could be worth exploring as something new . What do you think? Would you be willing To give it a shot ?
Demetrius: Yeah , Sure . Why not ? At this point ,I don ' t have anything else To lose .

Colorado massacre suspect makes initial court appearance

CENTENNIAL, Colo. The man accused of shooting dead 12 people in a Colorado movie theatre made his first appearance in court on Monday, sitting silently in a red jailhouse jump suit and with his hair dyed bright red.

Formal charges against James Eagan Holmes, 24, will be filed on July 30, the judge presiding over the proceeding said. A public defender was appointed as his attorney.

Police say Holmes was dressed in body armour and toting three guns when he opened fire at a packed midnight screening of the new Batman movie early Friday. Fifty-eight people were wounded.

Holmes was apprehended moments after the massacre. Police say they are still searching for a motive for the crime.

On a live television broadcast of the proceedings, Holmes could be seen sitting silently, looking straight ahead, occasionally closing his eyes.

"Suggestions, Matlab vs Excel to automate data and results? I want to automate the following:  Taking data from a process (chromatography), and displaying it with the end results that must be figured out by hand.  So, the data can be extracted fairly easily from the chromatography program, as an excel document. Now, I want to come up with a way to program a bunch of equations with manipulable constants/boundaries/etc that make it as simple as typing in the data and everything be calculated. One step further is to somehow make it so the data can be imported and manipulated on it's own.  I have Matlab experience, but know that Excel could probably do this.

President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in 5 months

Authorities in Nepal on Sunday tightened security around the Supreme Court building and government offices here as top leaders of the Opposition alliance prepared to file a writ petition at the apex court against the ""unconstitutional"" dissolution of the House of Representatives by the President, according to a media report.

President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in five months and announced snap elections in November on the advice of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, heading a minority government.

She rejected the bids of both embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a government.

The announcement came after Prime Minister Oli in his last deal-sealing move on Friday midnight recommended the Office of the President to dissolve the 275-member House and announce dates for early elections.

As leaders of the Opposition alliance prepared to move the court, security forces have increased vigilance around the Singhadurbar-Supreme Court area, The Himalayan Times reported.

The security has been tightened in a bid to avert crowding and protests, a Nepali Police official stated.

Police have made a few arrests on Sunday as political groups have taken to the streets to protest the government's move.

Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal and the Rastriya Janamorcha leaders were gathering signatures of their lawmakers before filing the writ.

On the other hand, leaders from Madhav Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal-led faction of ruling CPN-UML are expected to submit their signatures too.

The Opposition alliance on Saturday convened a meeting to discuss their strategies forward and decided to unitedly fight the unconstitutional, regressive, autocratic move of the government by every political and legal means possible.

In a joint statement issued at the end of their meeting, the Opposition leaders said the President did not follow her constitutional responsibility of appointing a new prime minister based on the constitutional claim as per Article 76 (5) of the constitution with signatures of majority lawmakers.

""Instead she sided with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli with malafide intentions and dissolved Parliament in an attack on the Constitution and democracy. This regressive move has pushed the country towards new political polarisation and complexity,"" they said in a joint statement.

The president's announcement on Saturday plunged Nepal into further political crisis, a reminder of her December 2020 decision when she first dissolved the House at Oli's recommendation, a move that swayed the course of Nepali politics towards uncertainty.

The Supreme Court had annulled the duo's move in February. Nepal's political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday as embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition parties staked separate claims for the formation of a new government by submitting letters of support from lawmakers to the president.

Oli claimed the support of 121 lawmakers from his party CPN-UML and 32 lawmakers of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N) for his reappointment under Article 76(5) of the Constitution.

Nepali Congress President Deuba claimed to have garnered the support of 149 lawmakers.

However, a dispute emerged after a few lawmakers from the Madhav Nepal faction put out statements claiming that their signatures were misused and that they did not sign any paper to install Opposition leader Deuba as the prime minister against their party chief.

Earlier on Thursday, the president's office stated that the government had forwarded a request to invoke Article 76 (5) as Prime Minister Oli, it has been learnt, is in no mood to undergo another parliamentary floor test as there is no prospect of an otherwise result given the complex internal dynamics within parties represented in the federal parliament.

Meanwhile, Oli's CPN-UML party has initiated the process to take action against 11 lawmakers of the dissolved parliament on charges of supporting the Opposition party leader to oust the premier.

A Standing Committee meeting of the party held on Saturday decided to seek clarification from 11 lawmakers, including senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal. They were asked to furnish clarification by Monday morning.

Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).

Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Prachanda. In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.

"I’m an intern. Boss all but told me they probably won’t hire me, but wants to keep me as an intern until I graduate. Do I stay, or try to find an internship somewhere else while I can? TL;DR: Job isn’t guaranteed at my firm, but they want to keep me as an intern until December. I’m wondering if I should begin looking elsewhere, and whether I tell my boss if I do begin looking.  California. I’m at the end of my fourth quarter but taking one extra quarter in the fall to finish up, so I’ll be a student until the end of December. I’m not taking the extra quarter due to failed classes, but due to time restrictions (internship, leadership positions in clubs, etc.)  I’ve worked as a land development intern for ten months at a firm. The Vice President called me in the other day and told me he doesn’t think the company will hire me, mainly due to the fact that they hired three fresh-out-of-college engineers last year. He said they’re looking for someone with some more experience. I have a good relationship with my bosses, and it’s a great internship that I’ve learned a lot at.   That being said, he thought this was my last quarter, and held off telling me this until I potentially would’ve been 5 weeks away from graduation. He said I can stay on as an intern until December.  That being said, would it be better to find another company to work for? There’s some openings at several good, well-respected firms for an entry level engineer, and I already meet all the requirements (Civil 3D experience, familiar with the processes, FE), with the exception of having my actual degree. I’m considering letting these other companies know I’d be willing to be an intern while they train me during the on-boarding process, which (I’m assuming) might be appealing to them as it wouldn’t cost them as much. I’m basically willing to be an intern for these companies until I get my actual degree.  This is all triggered by the r/all LPT, that if I’m looking for a job or considering changing, that I shouldn’t tell my employer. If I do look for this other job, should I keep it a secret? Or let my boss know?   Potentially relevant information: GPA is 3.3, and I’ve never failed a class, so there is not a risk of me not getting a degree.  My resume has leadership, volunteering, and relevant experience for this field."

"Background:
<start of reference>
A large silver-blue BMW backed out and drove away in the opposite direction down the street. It gave me a good view of the license plate, which read, ""4GRDNZ.""

The driver's hair was cropped short. Sitting so tall in the seat, I assumed it was a man.

Pretty intimate, parking in the garage like that.

Okay, Jillian, time's up.

Just remember you are coming to see their gardens. Polite conversation with a little observation is what we need here. And remember, Jillian, _listen_.

After my personal pep talk, I pulled into the driveway hoping my car wouldn't leave oil stains on the spotless flagstone. They must have money to burn putting in a driveway like that.

The house itself was a large Tudor. Gray flagstone covered the exterior and made a stunning foil for the lovely yard. The gardens surrounding the house bloomed spectacularly. Purple mums lined the curved beds and the leaves on the trees had turned to red, gold and flaming orange.

I rang the doorbell, which sounded like Gothic chimes.

Immediately, Thomas opened the door and greeted me warmly, like a long lost relative. Maybe he was different at home.

""Do come in, Jillian. It's an honor to have you visit our home. Evelyn and I have looked forward to showing you our gardens."" He took my arm and led me into the living room.

The room's loveliness astounded me! Creamy sunlit yellow walls set off the Georgian silk and chintz-upholstered furniture. A large eight-armed crystal chandelier hung over the main conversation area in front of the white-columned and gray marble fireplace. A portrait of a beautiful young woman hung over the mantle.

""My, what an exquisite room."" My exclamation was an honest reaction.

""Thank you."" Thomas seemed pleased with my compliment. ""It's Evelyn's favorite room in the house.""

Looking at the portrait, I had to ask. ""Is this one of your ancestors, Thomas?""

He laughed. ""The clothes are outdated, but actually it's a portrait of Evelyn when we were first married."" He smiled up at her face, so fair and pretty, and then his smile turned to a frown as a voice spoke and chilled the once sunny room.

""Good afternoon, Jillian."" Evelyn's greeting sounded cold.

"CMV: the disappearance of Down syndrome in Iceland through abortion is not inherently evil or bad It just raises a few red flags because it sounds like Nazism. But it couldn't be farther from that. The idea of Nazism and most eugenics theories is to be applied top-down, while this is an emergent tendency from individual women taking decisions using the information available to them.  Now, I'm not saying that fetuses with down syndrome should be aborted (again, that would be a top-down imposition), or that this is good for humankind's genetic pool, or even that people with Down syndrome can't live happy, fulfilling lives. It's just that abortion laws ensure that women have full control of their body, and are able to decide if they want to continue a pregnancy for whatever reason they seem fit. Furthermore, it would be unjust to try to stop this, wether by prohibiting it in certain cases or withholding information, as it's done in some countries, as it would deprive women from this right"

"\item {\bf Polar Transformation:} Given integers $i, j \in \{0,\ldots,2^{\ell}-1\}$ we say $i \preceq j$ if every digit in the binary representation of $i$ is at most the corresponding digit in the binary representation of $j$. Formally if $i = \sum\_{k=0}^{\ell-1} i\_k 2^k$ and $j = \sum\_{k=0}^{\ell-1} j\_k 2^k$ where $i\_0,\ldots,i\_{\ell-1},j\_0,\ldots,j\_{\ell-1} \in \{0,1\}$, then $i \preceq j$ if and only if $i\_k \leq j\_k$ for every $k \in \{0,\ldots,\ell-1\}$. For bits $a,b \in \{0,1\}$ let $a \oplus b$ denote their XOR or their sum modulo 2. (So $a\oplus b = 1$ iff $a \ne b$.) 

For $n = 2^{\ell}$ the Polar Transformation $P\_n$ transforms $n$ bits to $n$ bits as follows: $P\_n(x\_0,\ldots,x\_{n-1}) = (w\_0,\ldots,w\_{n-1})$ where
$$w\_j = \bigoplus\_{i \preceq j} x\_i.$$ (For instance, $w\_{20} = x\_{20} \oplus x\_{16} \oplus x\_4 \oplus x\_0$.) 
In 2008, Erdal Arikan proved that the Polar Transformation can be used to extract an asymptotically optimal number of ``nearly'' unbiased coin tosses from a collection of biased coins. Specifically, if the $x\_i$s are outputs of $n$ coins of known bias $p$, then there is a subset $S \subseteq \{0,\ldots,2^{\ell}-1\}$ with $|S| \approx A(p)\cdot n$, where $A(p)$ is the quantity defined in Lecture 1, such that $\{w\_i\}\_{i\in S}$ are nearly unbiased coins. (The actual definition of ``nearly unbiased'' is omitted in this description, and both it and the background starting ``In 2008'' are not needed to solve the problem.)

"Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: It was near Christmas during my first term teaching at a new school. I loved my small special class more than any group I had taught in the past. They were hungry for knowledge and I was enjoying teaching. Other teachers had told me that our children were from poor families and not to expect any child to bring a Christmas gift. In fact, I wasn't expecting any gifts. Imagine my surprise when every child brought me a gift on the day before our holiday break. First, I got a much-loved toy monkey from a shy girl. I was told, ""He is my favorite, but I love you and I want him to be with you, Miss Taylor."" How thrilled I was! Next came a new set of Christmas tree lights that was ""missing"" from a mother's cupboard . Finally, I came to one little boy's gift which I had never received. It was an old, dirty and broken Christmas storybook. Just when I wanted to show my happiness, I was interrupted  by the giver, ""And see, it is new! It still has the price tag ."" When other children laughed at him, I stopped them and said, ""Oh, books are good in that way. The story is always new if you have not read it before. Now, Let's read one together."" Everyone listened quietly as I read the most wonderful Christmas story of my life. I still keep those Christmas gifts. They always remind me of my lovely kids. Question: _   brought Miss Taylor a Christmas gift. Options: A: Every child B: Most of the children C: Only three children D: No one

'The fortunes of an old woman to whom Kate or I read every Friday,' said Elizabeth, 'and the fortunes of various young school-children, who must be prepared for Papa or Mr. Walker to catechize in Church on Sunday.' 

'Why do not you send Kate or Helen, instead of murdering yourself in the wet?' said Anne. 

'Miss Kitty is three inches deep in the mysteries of a spencer, (I do not mean Edmund,)' said Elizabeth, 'and it will not be out of her head these three days, at least not till she has made Mamma's old black satin gown into one after Harriet's pattern; I heard her asking for it as I came up-stairs.' 

'And would not Helen go?' said Anne; 'she does not catch cold as easily as you do.' 

'Helen has contrived, somehow or other,' said Elizabeth, 'to know no more about the school-children than if they were so many Esquimaux; besides, anyone with any experience of Helen's ways, had rather walk ninety miles in the rain, than be at the pains of routing her out of the corner of the sofa to do anything useful.'

If Abbott is serious about tackling terrorism, cutting foreign aid is the worst way to go about it. In conjunction with the joint military action against Islamic State (Isis), Tony Abbott has pledged $5m in humanitarian aid for Iraq on his recent surprise visit to Baghdad . But don't be fooled by the government's apparent show of generosity - Australia isn't giving any more to foreign aid than it was before . In fact ,  it is giving significantly less . It is vitally important that we don't stop talking about recent cuts to foreign aid . The government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has reduced the foreign aid budget to the lowest levels in Australian history . Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years . In addition to the $7.6bn already cut in May's federal budget, foreign aid has been cut by one quarter . If the government is serious about tackling terrorist threats and defending ""universal values"" , cutting off foreign aid to programmes that provide education, reduce poverty and improve gender equality is one of the worst ways to go about it . The Save Australian Aid campaign states that $11bn in foreign aid - the amount cut from the foreign aid budget in the past year - is the equivalent of 2 million children who may not be able to enrol in school, 1.4 million births without a birth attendant, 3.7 million children who may not receive vaccinations, 4.7 million people who will have reduced access to safe water, and almost 22 million people with reduced assistance in emergency situations . These cuts further perpetuate the idea that Australia is not a team player, a notion fuelled by our past behaviour towards our neighbours, and our recent denials of international obligations towards asylum seekers and climate change . In addition to the cuts in the Myefo, Australia backed out of commitments made to tax justice in the recent G20 summit . It is estimated that developing nations lose $160bn per year to corporate tax dodging; an amount that would end world hunger three times over . The G20 commitment, Abbott said, was ""about the countries of the world, the people of the world, receiving the tax benefits that are their due and it's needed so that governments can fund the infrastructure and the services that people expect and deserve."" As the host of the G20, backing out of this commitment not only damages our international credibility, but also has a huge impact on the developing world . The foreign aid cuts are irresponsible, but not surprising . Cutting the aid budget sends a clear message to our developing neighbours that Australia won't lend a helping hand unless it's in our own best interest . However ,  our politicians seem to forget that there is something in it for us, and not only in Iraq . Aid is much more than a humanitarian gesture ; it's a tool for regional development, trust and cooperation . Foreign aid programmes promote stability through education and equality, in turn reducing conflict . As an added bonus, foreign aid and sustainable development programmes create stronger economies , which in turn create opportunities at home and abroad . Poverty breeds hopelessness and despair , which are both contributing factors to extremist behaviour . Foreign aid is not the only factor in answering this issue , but it's more than a step in the right direction . Higher levels of foreign aid have the potential not to only alleviate extreme poverty in our region, but to raise international opinion of Australia as a fair country . A recent study examining the effects of foreign aid on foreign public opinion found that US aid programmes targeting HIV/Aids have improved perceptions of the US among the public in recipient countries . Australia would reap these benefits as a side effect of foreign aid, saving the millions of dollars set aside to ""stop the boats"" and wage a ""war on terror"" . But our government has, predictably, made yet another irresponsible decision with untold repercussions . While two innocent people died in Martin Place on 16 December in what has been labelled an act of terror , a reduction of this size in the foreign aid budget will result in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds across the globe due to reduced access to vital services . The high priority the Abbott government has placed on security doesn't come cheap, with funds for anti-terrorism programmes costing billions of dollars . Wouldn't this money be better spent reducing inequality, poverty, and conflict? Shouldn't we be stopping the problem at the source, not trying to cure the symptoms?

"CMV: Banning abortion in the US has and will backfire If you're trying to reduce abortions, I think banning abortion is not the right way to do it. If history has taught us anything, it's that Americans don't like things being banned if a big enough part of the population likes it. For example, alcohol during Prohibition or increased sale of assault weapons when talks of a ban on them go around.  Abortion bans might reduce them in the short term but in the long term, I don't think so.  In my opinion, Republicans should allow abortion and put more things in place to get an abortion that might weed people out on the way like counseling, adoption services and ultrasounds.  The GOP should also try to convince people through debates, logical and emotional appeals to not get an abortion rather than bans."

I sat down at the kitchen table and flipped the paper open to the obituaries. Mary had kept her word, at least in terms of Taylor's death notice. The tidy history of Major Jesse Taylor lay before me in black ink on the dull grey pulp.

'Sterile', she had called it.

Yeah, well maybe it had lacked soul. I didn't care. The message was honest, and that was enough for the general public. The firestorm would come, no doubt, but I didn't want to be the one to throw the match.

While I read over the good parts of Taylor's life, a transformer exploded somewhere far off, and the lights in my room dimmed until they finally extinguished.

Sitting in the dark, I considered trying to go back to sleep, but then I heard the unmistakable loud pop of a second transformer failing.

""Gotta be a power surge,"" I said.

Then the silence was shattered again by a third explosion, a foundation-rattling blast.

""What the...?"" I walked to the window and peeked outside. The whole campus seemed to be without power. The crescent moon provided the only light for miles. Though I had hoped to see several electrical crews working, the street was deserted, and a sudden need to go outside overwhelmed me. I felt my way through the darkness to the door, hoping that when I opened it, I would find light on the other side.

The hallway was just as dark, and after I closed the door behind me, cutting off the dim moonlight, the pitch black felt viscous. My throat tightened and my breathing quickened. I pulled in each breath through my open mouth to make as little noise as possible. When the floor creaked below my feet, dread like I've never experienced stabbed through me.

Every step was deliberate, careful. I did not know why I was so frightened, but fear is immune to logic, so I walked slowly toward the faint red glow of the exit sign at the end of the hall. I sensed the doors to my sides as I went, and my jaw tightened in anticipation of them bursting open. Absolute silence would be my only protection from what may lie ahead, sneak up from behind, or attack from either side.

I stared at the glowing sign and watched it grow larger with every small step. It felt like a lifetime, maybe even longer, but I finally made it to the door and let out a relieved sigh as I pressed on the latch and pushed. The door creaked open, and I stepped out onto the fire escape, looked up at the starless night sky, and took in deep breaths of the cool March air.

Light from the fingernail moon reflected off of the fog, creating a broken halo effect. The parking lot below the fire escape was mostly empty, and at the far end, the seemingly black leaves of the maple trees swayed, beckoning me forward.

I descended the rusted staircase, scanning for signs of movement. The campus was supposed to have a couple dozen people stationed, and soldiers were always outside regardless of the hour...yet everything was eerily still.

I kept looking back down to the parking lot, then my attention fell on a car and I couldn't pull my gaze away. There was something about it.

I racked my mind trying to find a reason why that car seemed so familiar, then a memory flashed: Me standing on the fire escape, calling out to Mary, letting her know to come up that way to avoid the soldier at the front desk.

The car belonged to her.

I quickened my pace. Once off the steps, I ran through the parking lot, hoping I had been mistaken. As I approached the front of the car, a figure standing in the grass at the edge of the parking lot darted into the shadow of the building. ""Mary?"" I called out and heard footsteps running on pavement, drawing closer.

I rounded the corner of the car and had a fraction of a second to register the butt end of a rifle before it slammed into my face.

***

I opened my eyes and my vision cleared on a pair of loafers standing on the pavement. A hand came down and slapped my cheek, then one of the shoes kicked me in the ribs, rolling me onto my back. I heard the unmistakable chi-chink of a pump-action shotgun, then a barrel appeared inches from my eyes.

The gun moved aside. Yang stood over me, eyes wide and bloodshot, jaw clenched and trembling. ""I thought you were one of them,"" he said, hold out his hand.

I stared at it, but didn't move.

""Get up, Jon,"" he insisted. I gripped his hand, and he pulled me to my feet. ""You all right?""

I spit out a mouthful of blood. ""Think I swallowed a tooth,"" I said, rubbing the side of my face.

Yang smiled.

God, it’s good to be back in Albuquerque.

That wasn’t the way I was planning to start this review, but after Better Call Saul’s premiere episode, the feeling overwhelms me. Albuquerque is more than a setting, more than a fond reminder of the glory days of Breaking Bad. It’s Vince Gilligan’s muse. The flatness, the curves of the cul-de-sacs, the strip malls, the looming empty sky. It’s a place where desperation lies under a thin layer of xeriscaping. Through Gilligan’s eyes, Albuquerque is less of an oasis than a last-chance saloon. Beyond is the wasteland, the buzzards, the war of every man against every man.

Albuquerque is all the more welcome because Gilligan and Peter Gould, the co-writers of “Uno,” make us wait for it. The episode starts with a black-and-white flash-forward to a Cinnabon in an Omaha mall (as foretold in BB’s “Granite State”), where the man we know as Saul Goodman wears a visor, portions out dough, and feels his blood freeze solid when a blank-faced, no-neck man stares at him. It’s a gorgeous opening, full of telling and well-observed detail (Saul’s bald spot, the spacers used to position buns on baking sheets, the little three-wheeled dolly that gets kicked under the giant mixing bowl to move it) and serendipitous shots (the wide-angle view from the mall’s second level, the escalator’s POV). But when the color kicks in and the great state of New Mexico takes the stage, you remember that it wasn’t just Walt and Jesse and Hank and the minerals, Marie, that made Breaking Bad so mesmerizing. It was also the baleful beauty of their stomping grounds, the place they paced like rats in a maze, trying to find the lever that would render it habitable.

“Uno” has a lot of backstory to set up, and at times the seams show as Gilligan and Gould seek the best way to disclose and withhold. We follow early-2000s Saul—known in those pre-scumbag days by his real name, Jimmy McGill—as he fails to win an acquittal for his douchebag teenage clients (“near Honors students, all”) on a charge of breaking into a funeral home, sawing off a corpse’s head, and having sex with it. (“Trespassing? A bit of a reach, don’t you think, Dave?” Saul chides the prosecuting attorney.) Poorly-compensated public defender work is leaving him so far in a financial hole that he trudges back to the courthouse for another validation stamp on his parking stub rather than fork over $3 to an unsympathetic Mike Ehrmantraut. Yet back in his office, which doubles as the boiler room of a nail salon (“Cucumber water for customer only!”) he tears up a $26,000 check and storms over to the firm that sent it, Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill. Seems they’re acting as if Chuck McGill is still on the payroll, despite some ailment that has forced him to take a leave of absence, and Jimmy thinks it’s a ploy to deprive his brother (Michael McKean) of his rightful share of the practice—$17 million, by Jimmy’s rough initial estimate.

Chuck’s place requires visitors to leave their keys and phone in the mailbox and ground themselves before entering; it appears he’s suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He lives by lantern light, pounds out letters to Finnish researchers on a manual typewriter, keeps the groceries Jimmy brings in an ice-filled cooler, and reimburses him for the Financial Times with cash out of a coffee canister. Gently, he deflects Jimmy’s pleas to demand a buyout from his partners, objecting that the firm would probably have to liquidate to raise that much cash, putting more than a hundred people out of work. Besides, he’s going to get better and go back to work. Oh, and it might confuse that Jimmy is using the name McGill in his practice’s name and advertising. “How about Vanguard Law? Or Gibraltar?” Chuck suggests helpfully.

Neither Jimmy’s ambulance-chasing (in the form of soliciting folks whose connections to crime make the newspaper) nor his connections to Chuck McGill are going to pay his overdue bills. No, he’s going to have to go back to his days as Slippin’ Jimmy, the Cicero kid who raked in cash by prat falling on patches of ice every winter. He enlists two skateboarders whose awkward attempt at a shakedown he had avoided earlier and goes after Betsy Kettleman, the county treasurer’s wife, whose route to pick up her kids at school intersects with a blind corner, a video camera, street surfing beardos, and convenient witnesses at an outdoor café. Then Slippin’ Jimmy McGill plans to swoop in and offer his legal surfaces to the distressed vehicular assailant. But the station wagon roars off instead of stopping, to the dismay of the skateboarders but not Jimmy, whose eyes turn into dollar signs at the prospect of defending a felony hit-and-run case. If only the driver weren’t an elderly Hispanic woman rather than the boat-owning suburbanite Jimmy targeted, and if only the boarders’ freelance demand for “righteous dinero” didn’t take them into her home, where minutes later Tuco meets Jimmy the door with a gun.

The maneuvers and info-dumps necessary to get us to this, the point of departure for this series, are probably as adroitly handled as one could hope for. Yes, the scene in Chuck’s no-electricity-allowed hideaway is coy almost to the point of frustration, but look how beautifully Gilligan and Gould handle Jimmy’s decision to quit chasing the ambulances and start dispatching them himself. The scene where the treasurer meets with Jimmy at the diner about the $1.6 million “accounting discrepancy,” culminating in the slow-motion moment where his wife stops him from signing the retainer, perfectly illustrates the fragility of Jimmy’s practice. And it’s bookended not only by Jimmy’s repeated references to combing the newspaper for potential clients, but also by the last-straw moment where the treasurer and his wife show up at Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill.

“Uno” reacquaints us with a character whose spiel is as slick and sludgy as motor oil, and shows us that his paranoia and misanthropy come from years of being kicked around. He’s desperate to be the one doing the kicking for a change—and lucky for us, there are few things funnier and more pathetic than Bob Odenkirk kicking somebody or something. (In this episode alone: skateboarders and an unlucky trash can.) Inside Tuco’s house, there’s a rich but dangerous vein of untapped cash potential. What we see from “Uno” is that he doesn’t have to stoop down very much farther to pick it up.

"CMV: We should not allow media companies to run the Presidential Debates Here are the main reasons I believe this:  1. The current Presidential debate format is a joke and is an embarrassment to our country. Participants should not be allowed to interrupt, participants should not be asked more questions than another, and participants should not be allowed to get 3x the speaking time as others. 2. Media companies are incentivized to make the debate as entertaining as possible, not informative, truthful, fair, etc. 3. Media companies make a ton of money from these highly viewed events. They also own the rights to all the footage, making it inaccessible to many. 4. Media companies are typically biased and susceptible to outside forces (advertisers, foreign countries, broadcasters) leading to some preference for one candidate over another.  5. I believe we should have a publicly funded series of debates organized by people from across the political spectrum."

"Change my view thatWe should all stop eating meat in the long-term I currently eat meat and enjoy it, love a BBQ, eat beef, chicken etc. but I would probably get used to it if a government came in that banned the meat industry.  Livestock, especially cows, take up so much of the worlds farmland that could be better utilized growing crops and also places like the Amazon are shrinking due to grazing.  Animal suffering is another thing, most animals which are used as livestock can feel pain and suffer in that job role. There may be a large initial cull but the benefit over time will reduce suffering in the long run. We can survive by eating non-meat foods, not necessarily vegan but not meat, there are lots of other protein sources and many people around the world are vegetarian and are not malnourished. One example which could be a counter-argument is that 30-40% of Indians are vegetarian and there are high levels of malnutrition in the country, but this is more a socioeconomic thing i.e. general food intake due to being poor, as well as the types of foods people eat such as cereals over things with more protein like eggs, as richer vegetarians in India are not generally malnourished.  Also red meat specifically has been linked to increased risk of some cancers, although of course the counter could be ""what doesn't cause cancer these days amirite!?""  So it would probably be better for the environment, suffering of the animals and our general health"

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house.

One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: ""My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own"". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her ""fascination with writing and storytelling"" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by ""the great female country artists of the '90s""--Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: ""Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it"". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is ""an amazing example to every female songwriter out there"". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.  Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: ""They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers"". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel ""as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that"". She admires Springsteen for being ""so musically relevant after such a long period of time"". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: ""It's not about fame for her, it's about music"". ""[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out"", Swift says. She admires Simon's ""songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person"".  Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has ""unwavering devotion"" for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Fefe Dobson and Justin Timberlake; and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and ""Like a Prayer-era Madonna""."

"Jake can wash his car with 1 bottle of car wash soap 4 times. If each bottle costs $4.00, and he washes his car once a week for 20 weeks, how much does he spend on car soap? Give the rationale and then the answer.
Let's think step by step. 1 bottle of soap will last for 4 washes and he needs enough bottles for 20 weeks so 20 / 4 = 5 bottles. Each bottle cost $4.00 and he needs 5 bottles so he will spend $4 * 5 = $20.00 on car soap.. The answer is: 20.

A farmer has 46 chickens. Each chicken gives him 6 eggs a week. If he sells a dozen eggs for $3, how much money would he make in 8 weeks? Give the rationale and then the answer.
Let's think step by step. The farmer gets 46 x 6 = 276 eggs a week. That gives him 276 / 12 = 23 dozen eggs. In one week, he makes 23 x 3 = $69. In 8 weeks, he makes $69 x 8 = $552.. The answer is: 552.

"[TN] Coworkers spreading rumors about favoritism and an inappropriate relationship going on between me and my boss. Recently, a coworker of mine (Eric 45M) confronted me 30F and my manager 42M on a call saying that ""what's going on between the two of you is so obvious, that it's a running joke with the department"", that I spend so much time in my manger's office (glass door so no privacy). That people outside the department see it as well.... and was alluding that there was an affair going on. There isnt. Looking back, years back, I remember I had my phone out during lunch and I got a text from my bf who has the same first name as my manager (John). Eric was looking at my phone and I think he read that message, but I'm not sure. But that is the only instance I can think of.  Another coworker Kate 55F was spreading that same rumor and also added in that when I make mistakes my boss covers it up, and also called out favoritism. This started after Eric and Kate went on a business trip together.   Both Kate and Eric were placed on performance improvement plans for their poor performances (this they openly said and complained about and was at different times). I never was placed on a plan. I have made mistakes before, but I resolve it before it becomes an issue. What's frustrating is I've taught both Kate and Eric different things to help make their jobs easier. When Kate was on the improvement plan I noticed my workload increased significantly and Kate's drastically reduced. She complained about her decrease in workload openly. I went to my manager and he basically said he wanted to give her a best shot so with less work she can really learn the process. When my manager said this, I didnt complain I said ok I understand and worked harder. I've since been promoted.  I'm at the point where I cant stand Kate and Eric. They've spread these rumors about me and when they arent getting what they need faster than they want it, they have gone over my boss's head to my sr. director. I've gone to HR about this for Eric, would it look bad if I add in Kate as well? Bc I don't want to give off the impression that I have issues with so many people.   Sorry this post is scattered, I'm so overwhelmed and frustrated. I'll be happy to answer any questions.  What are my options?"

"Cantonese/Southern Chinese Cookbooks I recently purchased two Fuchsia Dunlop books on regional Chinese cooking--*The Food of Sichuan* and *Land of Fish and Rice* (Jiangnan)--and I was blown away. The focus on what makes a region special including descriptions of techniques, ingredients, a bit of history, etc. is exactly what I'm looking for. They're also massive books with tons of recipes representing a diverse range of dishes in the region (including recipes influenced from outside the region but adapted for local tastes). And it's easy to follow, particularly for a Westerner shopping at mostly Western supermarkets. I also bought Terry Tan's Mandarin that has 75 Northern Chinese recipes. It's not nearly as nice, but it's still good enough for these purposes. But it doesn't look like Fuchsia Dunlop wrote a book on Cantonese cooking.  I say Cantonese, but I'm also ok with anything focusing on South China (meaning Huanan 華南): Guangdong Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau (maybe Fujian, but I'm not sure). I'm not looking for a dim sum book. (I wouldn't mind some dim sum recipes, but I wouldn't want that as a focus). I'm also not looking for American Cantonese. And I'm definitely not looking for a book on Chinese food in general that happens to have a lot of Cantonese recipes.  Does anyone have any recommendations for quality cookbooks focusing on South China? I do follow Chinese Cooking Demystified on YouTube and I think those are the type of recipes I'm looking for. Thanks in advance and I look forward to seeing your recommendations.  (Apologies if this post is against the rules; I didn't see an appropriate flair)"

"CMV: Pronouns are great, but the over the top pronouns are doing more harm than people realize. So pronouns are great, and I think workplaces, and schools, etc asking the people what their pronouns are, is also great.     * He/Him   * She/Her   * They/Them    * Xe/xem  However, recently there has been an uptick in people, mainly younger persons, going by Bug/Bugself, God/Godself, Kitten/Kittenself etc.    To me, those are nicknames, they arent your actual pronouns. You cant sit there and expect someone to call you that, and get mad when they dont. Some people arent comfortable calling you a god, or a kitten, and its not transphobic for someone to not do that. Its not a big deal, and Ill respect them If I'm comfortable with them. But this just does more harm to the community than anything. It makes those people who use alternative pronouns, look bad.     I'm even fine with neoprounons like xe/xem, but I cant bring myself to refer to you as ""God' or ""Kitten"", and I guess I feel that you can't tell me that's legitimately how you identify.     It seems like its making a mockery of actual nonbinary persons who use alternative pronouns, and just does more harm than anything."

Many made the argument that his actions disrespected the military, or that they disrespected the nation. **The national anthem does not represent the military, the national anthem represents the country.** Though the lyrics of the anthem are about a military engagement, it is meant to stir up patriotism, not to promote the military.   If you don't understand the purpose of his kneeling, at least understand that kneeling for the national anthem doesn't disrespect the military."

Previous trigger points relied on the crucial 14-day average of cases in Melbourne but moving to step three will be dependent on the average for all of Victoria.

There also have to be fewer than five ""mystery"" cases statewide – those without a known source of infection – over the prior two weeks for restrictions to be eased further.

But Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has a message of hope for those fretting on Victoria's chances of cracking the crucial five-cases-a-day threshold. It's the mystery cases that matter, he said.

Professor Sutton said he and his colleagues were now placing greater weight on the ""story"" behind each diagnosis. He said the raw daily case numbers were now less important for the big-picture decisions than the origin of each individual infection and whether it could be tracked and traced.

Meanwhile, the results of a snap SMS poll show Melburnians believe they should now be allowed to travel more than five kilometres from their homes.

A Roy Morgan survey of 2223 Victorians on Monday and Tuesday showed more people support lifting three key lockdown restrictions now than two or three weeks ago, with 61 per cent of respondents wanting the five-kilometre travel rule to be immediately axed, up 11 per cent from two weeks ago.

The biggest shift in consensus was on the topic of indoor dining – 56 per cent of those surveyed said Melbourne restaurants, pubs and cafes should be allowed to offer table service, up 19 per cent from three weeks ago.

And 59 per cent said Melbourne residents should be able to visit the homes of their immediate family members, up 4 per cent from two weeks ago.

Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four more deaths on Wednesday.

Loading

Two of those cases were household contacts of aged care workers from Estia Health Keilor and Edenvale Manor in Keilor East. Another two were linked to Chadstone Shopping Centre which has been identified as a new high-risk exposure site.

Warnings have been released for anyone who spent time at Coles, The Butcher Club or the Fresh Food Precinct at Chadstone between Wednesday and Saturday last week (between 6am and 6pm).

FOURTEEN

I had words with my father today. He was not exactly protesting the book but neither was he enthused at its publication. He asked me about the first three chapters. I had been dreading this conversation.

You see, the first three chapters required no real re-writing. If you recall, they were me outlining my reasons for writing a book about my father's obsession. They were perfect as they were, the only part of the first draft that could've remained as originally written. But I completely re-wrote them. It may have been the alcohol, it may have been my presumption of forgiveness, it may have been my selfishness and it may have been a combination of all three, I don't really know and I'm not willing to closely examine the question. What I'm trying to say is, that I re-wrote the first three chapters of the book with its bias in my favour. That's right; yet again I deconstructed history and came up with my name in the prominent role. I chose to make my fathers' work my own. He wished to know why. Truly my forgiveness has been short lived.

Opening a bottle of vodka, I tried as best as I would allow to explain to my father his second term of dismissal. His terms, not mine. I would've been much harsher. He accused me (rather unfairly I thought) of trying to kill him off. He said that using his words in conjunction with my own, he was effectively neutered, or to use his phrase, he was 'writing-dead' whereas I was just 'writing-poor.' I countered with the fact that I used substantially more of my own language than of his, his words were paraphrased with my own writing. But if that were so, he said, why did you need my writings as a catalyst for your book? Surely the idea was in your head before your encounter? And lastly, who did you think taught you most of that language in the first place - your mother? And I had to admit that he made a good argument. I poured another vodka each and thought about his points. If what he said were true (and I more than suspected that it was) then the whole basis of my thinking (which was centered on my father's obsessions and my mother's talents) became nothing more than a box of lies. It would rationally lead me to thinking - who was the true writer in the family? Had my mother been making up her talents all this time? And if so, why would my father go along with it? He was always the one claiming a love for the pen, never my mother. And now that I thought about it, my mother wrote nothing after my father's death. Has her life story been only an invention? My father left me alone and I finished the vodka. Had my obsession with obsession blinded me so easily? Was there a truth to be found and could it be believed? What is truth anymore? Only one person would know. But would she tell?

Her speech is still slurred. I tried but I'm not sure she understood, let alone could reply. The wait will not be easy.

My whole life has perhaps been a fiction. Yet it bothers me much less than I wish it would. But wait, that's a lie unto itself isn't it? I don't know, can you take a literary work and make a movie out of it? Not that I'm equating myself with literature, I'm only pursuing the question. Am I truly bothered as much as I imagine myself to be? How much is enough? I know one thing, I certainly don't feel as obsessed as I once was; I mean, I'm still asking myself the questions but I'm less inclined to dwell on them. My father's book being the classic example, the obsession with obsession that I was so intent on proving not a factor in my life, became my life for close to three years. Now of course the book is out and I no longer need to push myself to those limits of endurance. The ultimate climax from that period has now been seen to be as fake as the period of Conversations. I can only use so much perspiration before even I wake up to the fact that the effort sometimes outweighs the result.

"In evolutionary theory, how do we distinguish adaptation within a species from evolving/diverting into new species? Let me make this clear: I'm not a creationist in a way, shape or form, and actually a huge fan of Darwin's and Dawkin's work. I am just interested in the subject but came across this discussion on one of Veratasium's latest video, The Longest-Running Evolution Experiment, which I found very interesting.    The experiment is presented as evolution, but to my layman eyes it just appears to be adaptation within the species of the bacteria. Now I know evolution is a slow process, (and I'm by no means condemning anything said in the video!!) but I would love some explanation that distinguishes these ideas. Is the only difference the timeframe at which the mutations take place?  When looking up other videos on evolution, Minute Earth for example, you often come across the example of the polar bear: where a black or brown species of bear migrated to colder climates, where mutated offspring with lighter or white fur had a better chance of survival (survival of the fittest). But this also seems like adaptation within a species"

The unloved feeling that Khaliah has developed has led her into a state of depression. She feels as though nobody cares for her and that she is completely alone in the world. This saddens her greatly and she often finds herself in tears, wondering why nobody loves her.

Khaliah: I just don't understand why nobody loves me. I've done everything I can to be a good person and yet nobody seems to care.
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really lonely and isolated right now.
Khaliah: Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like there's nobody out there who cares about me or even likes me.
Therapist: That's a really tough way to feel. Do you want to talk about what might be contributing to that?
Khaliah: I don't know. It just feels like no matter what I do, it's not good enough for anyone. And even when people do show interest in me, it never lasts long before they lose interest and move on to someone else.
Therapist: That does sound discouraging. Can you think of any times when you have felt loved or cared for?
Khaliah: Yeah, there have been a few times... but mostly it just feels like people are using me or taking advantage of me because they know I'm desperate for attention. So even those times don't really feel genuine or lasting.
Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've really been hurt by some people in your life.
Khaliah: Yeah, I have. And I just don't understand why. What did I do to deserve this?
Therapist: Khaliah, you didn't do anything to deserve this. This is not your fault.
Khaliah: But it feels like it is. Like there's something wrong with me that makes people not want to be around me for long.
Therapist: That's not true, Khaliah. There is nothing wrong with you. You are a good person who has been through a lot of tough experiences. That doesn't mean that you're undeserving of love and attention, it just means that you might have to work a little harder to find those things because of the pain that you've experienced in the past.
Khaliah: I don't know...I just feel so alone all the time and it hurts so much.
Therapist: I'm here for you, Khaliah. We can talk about this as much as you need to and we will work together to try and find ways to make you feel better.

Thinking about buying a Tesla? Something you'll want to know is how long the battery lasts and how long you can drive before a new one is needed.
Electric cars are shaping up to be the future of clean transportation. As one of the most popular manufacturers of electric cars, people often wonder: how many miles does a Tesla last over its lifetime?
How many miles will your Tesla drive before you need to replace the battery pack, motor, or other vital components? If you keep replacing the batteries and the motor, how many miles can it last? What else do you need to do to make your Tesla last as long as possible?
Predicting how long Tesla batteries will last is easy if you look at the company’s warranty model. Tesla states that if your vehicle's traction battery has less than 70 percent of its capacity left at the end of its warranty period, you’re eligible for a repair or replacement. The battery warranty depends on the car model, but it usually lasts for up to eight years when Tesla expects the average driver to cover between 100,000 and 150,000 miles.
If you don’t mind driving around with a slightly underperforming battery that will provide less range, then you can expect to keep the same battery for anywhere between 300,000 and 500,000 miles, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter. That’s over two decades of driving before you’ll have to replace your Tesla battery, which is on the expensive side, starting at around $5,000 per battery module (of which there can be up to 16 in a Tesla battery pack).
If you replace the battery pack, though, it’s possible to cover over 1 million miles with your Tesla if you look after the rest of the vehicle. In fact, one of the longest-lasting Teslas had surpassed one million miles as of 2022. It is a 2014 Model S P85, and in the 2019 video embedded above, its owner was celebrating having reached the 1-million kilometer mark, or just over 620,000 miles.

The question “why” comes up. a lot, and I’ll be thinking stuff like: Who invented this? why do we do things this way? why not that way? who’s to say I’m wrong when we don’t really know anything about anything?  I find myself trying to get to the bottom of everything, which is obviously a very time consuming project. I don’t know I’m sometimes so skeptical of things, even when I understand them. maybe I don’t fully understand them after all.   I’ll be in the middle of a chapter, thinking I understand it - after all I’ve practiced and watched videos and read a ton about a subject and suddenly I’ll question whether or not I understand anything at all.    **But how do I stop this? How do I stop overthinking abstract concepts like math and physical concepts so much that’s actually an obstacle in my studies?**  *obligatory sorry for my english and/or if this doesn’t belong here. it’s just frustrating me.*"

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

As the 1920s turned into the 1930s, women’s fashion softly evolved from the boyish look of the previous decade into the feminine silhouette of the early thirties. With the stock market crash in 1929 and with the opening of the new decade, hemlines descended back to ankle length and waistlines moved back to their natural place. Despite these departures from the prevailing mode of the previous decade, the popular styles of the early 1930s were similar in their simple lines to the popular garçonne look of the twenties. But while the simplicity of the 1920s created a sack-like silhouette free from curves, the simple lines of the early thirties hugged those curves, creating a soft, feminine silhouette. Cally Blackman, a lecturer on the history of fashion at Central Saint Martins, writes in 100 Years of Fashion, “By the early 1930s, the fashionable silhouette was evolving into a slender, elongated torso with widening shoulders and a neat head with softly waved short hair”. Though the lines were simple, the overall effect was one of complete sinuous femininity with a natural waist and skirts flaring out slightly at the ankle, as seen in a fashion illustration from 1935.

The Miss America Competition, which celebrated its 100th birthday this year, has now outlived key parties and manned missions to the moon, the VHS tape and the subway token, the Soviet Union and nitrate film. It outlives even itself, seeming to hang on more because the infrastructure remains in place than from anyone’s active desire to see it. And as last month’s streaming-only broadcast of the centennial pageant indicates, even inertia can get you only so far. People once watched Miss America on broadcast television, tens of millions of them; it was an institution of enough consequence to be worth protesting, as many did. But who needs a pageant these days? If you want to watch women strain to meet an ideal of femininity no person actually desires, you watch “The Bachelor.”

The reason to compete, on the other hand, hasn’t changed since 1945: It’s money, from scholarships and brand deals, and a platform from which to begin a career or initiative. This was certainly the case for Miss New York, Sydney Park, who, as Ej Dickson reported in Rolling Stone, entered the competition “after seeing an ad on Instagram to earn money” for school. And it was Park’s performance in the talent segment that highlighted, for me, the essential weirdness and bad faith at the heart of Miss America: No matter how much it might like to rebrand itself for the 21st century, it cannot escape the ideas of womanhood it was founded on.

Park performed a poem — her own poem — which begins: “When I was a little girl, I was told to sit like a lady.” But of course (the poem goes on) one can do many things “like a lady”: advocate for justice, or become vice president, and so on. Park performed this poem in a white pantsuit, which, if not a deliberate nod toward Hillary Clinton in 2016, was at least a visual rhyme. Her critique of ladylike behavior was delivered while modeling it at the same time — “back straight, chin up,” just as the poem describes, and shod in Louboutins. There was nothing unladylike to be found here, which was the point, but also the problem.

Miss America is not a beauty pageant, at least not to Miss America. It has insisted this since the late 1940s, when its executive director, Lenora Slaughter, told the New Yorker journalist Lillian Ross that “this is not a leg show and we don’t call the beauties bathing beauties any more. The bathing part went out in 1945, when we started giving big scholarships.” This was at a time when Miss America published every contestant’s physical measurements. (It was also segregated, but Slaughter’s apparent concern was that it might seem shallow, not bigoted.) As of 2018, Miss America claims not to judge participants by their appearances at all — it is only by happy accident that its participants are willowy and symmetrical.

Of course, it is a beauty pageant; has been; will be. Is there something wrong with that? Miss America plainly thinks so, or its denials would not be so elaborate and of such long duration. The beauties, it insists, are there to work hard, to showcase talent and accomplishment. Any candidate for the title has worked harder to get there, and harder in general, than I have in my entire life. Miss District of Columbia was getting her Ph.D. after two master’s degrees. Miss Utah, one of my favorites, is the C.E.O. of her own business. Miss Colorado serves in the military. But did millions tune in, for decades, to see women work hard?

Park’s poem frames itself as resistance to the expectations heaped on women, but like the pageant, she doesn’t even go as far as substituting one punishing goal for another — she just piles them on. Today’s ideal woman is still “porcelain perfection”; she just has to be a lawyer too. It’s similar to how Barbie is still Barbie in every sense that matters, but now she’s a scientist.

"I am trying to build typescript typings for a mod for Minecraft that runs an embedded version of JavaScript (via Mozilla Rhino). The mod uses 3 folders to load scripts depending on the environment (`server\_scripts`, `client\_scripts`, and `startup\_scripts`). The mod creates a folder structure like this:
```
kubejs
├── client\_scripts/
│ ├── script1.js
│ └── script2.js
├── server\_scripts/
│ ├── script1.js
│ └── script2.js
├── startup\_scripts/
│ ├── script1.js
│ └── script2.js
```

Each of these environment folders should have a different set of typings since the mod exposes different types based on the environment (in the global scope) and the mod uses namespaces, not modules, so I cant simply rely on modules to only import the correct types. Also, there are some shared types which I put in the `@kubejs/core` folder which needs to be accessible by `@kubejs/client`, `@kubejs/server`, and `@kubejs/startup`. I want to keep the typings out of the scripts folders because eventually I plan on putting them in their own repo so I have my project structured like this so far:
```
kubejs/
├── @types/
│ └── @kubejs/
│ ├── core/
│ │ ├── index.d.ts
│ │ └── tsconfig.json (extends `tsconfig.base.json`)

Spanish monastery admits girls to choir for first time in 700-year history
Mixed group to take over duties of Escolania choir at Montserrat monastery one weekend a month

Stephen Burgen in Barcelona
Wed 15 Mar 2023 09.54 EDT
Women and girls are to be admitted to a choir at the Montserrat monastery near Barcelona, home to the famous Escolania all-boys choir, for the first time in its 700-year history.

The new chamber choir, made up of a mix of about 25 boys and women and girls aged 17 to 24, will be separate from the Escolania, which comprises 45 boys aged nine to 14.

The monastery’s Father Efrem de Montellà said the mixed choir would take over the Escolania’s liturgical duties one weekend a month to give the boys a rest.

“We’re often asked why there aren’t any girls in the Escolania,” De Montellà said. “It’s a complex and difficult question. We follow a tradition that we would like to continue but we also realise we have to respond to demand.”

“In order to include all the girls who would like to sing at Montserrat and be escolanes we’ve decided to establish this second choir,” he added, describing it as a “historic step” for a choir that has been in continuous existence since the 13th century.

He said that although the philosophy behind the two choirs was the same, the director, Pau Jorquera, would decide on the ideal balance of voices.

After a lengthy debate, the move to include girls was decided in a vote by the Benedictine order that runs the monastery under the newly appointed abbot, Manel Gasch.

De Montellà said the new choir would complement rather than compete with the Escolania and both would wear the same vestment and sash.

Pupils at Montserrat study the standard school curriculum as well as learning to play the piano and one other instrument, while studying musical theory and choral singing.

As those in the choir are mostly boarders and are also called on to perform at weekends and feast days, De Montellà said this put a lot of strain on their families. By giving the choristers a weekend off each month, the mixed choir should help families decide if they wanted their child to join the Escolania, he said.

The monastery is a place of pilgrimage where people go to kiss the “black Madonna”, a 12th-century effigy of the Virgin of Montserrat. La Moreneta, as she is known, is a patron saint of Catalonia, along with Saint George.

The Escolania choir sing a hymn to the Virgin called El Virolai, which begins with the words “rose of April, dark-skinned woman of the mountain”.

This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from ""sympathetic"" to ""stern""). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender.

"Why do some vets perform procedures such as debarking, declawing or tail docking? I know that pets are legally treated as property and there aren't nearly as many strict laws around their care the same way there is with humans. But I still find it bizarre that cosmetic or otherwise unnecessary procedures with no known medical benefit are routinely performed when they are known to cause pain, distress, anxiety or health problems.  There is so much public discourse around people being bad or cruel or unfit pet owners because they buy a cat and then declaw them because they don't want them ruining their furniture, or get their dog's debarked because they are annoyed by the sound of their noisiness. Even in situations where there might be potential benefits such as docking working dog's tails to prevent possible future injury, or declawing cats because they're aggressive and causing injury to humans, most people seem to agree that the benefits don't outweigh the pain or distress caused to the animal when other measures like behavioural training can work. But I've rarely seen people address the fact that vets are performing these unethical procedures, in which case surely they bear as much responsibility as the owners?  Why do some vets perform these procedures? Is it about the money or keeping the owners happy? Or do they genuinely feel these procudes improve animals' quality of life?  As a vet, would you ever perform procedures like these? Why / why not? Would you judge other vets who take the opposite view?"

"[New Jersey] My mom is possibly hiding medical information and prescriptions from me, Is this legal? I am a 17 year old female, turning 18 in a week. Earlier this year I went to get a checkup and after doing the standard things the nurse asked my mom to leave the room so he could ask me a few things.  After asking me some questions, he asked if I had any. So I asked why is it that I have only had my period 2 times since I was 12 when I know it’s supposed to be monthly and I told him I was very concerned about it, I tried going to see a doctor for it sooner but my mom never allowed it and insisted I was fine. The nurse looked concerned and asked follow up questions and went back to talk to my mom, after some time, I was told I would come back in about a week to take some blood tests. The entire car ride home, my mom is just glaring at me and saying I shouldn’t be making a big deal out of it.   A week later, I go in and have some blood taken so tests can be run. About two months pass and I do what the my doctor suggested, exercising more and avoiding fat/ sugary  foods since it was possible that the problem could be my weight, still nothing. One day I’m looking through the mail and I see a letter for me. I couldn’t understand it much, but it was results of my blood test and then a small note that I couldn’t read before my mom toke it from my hands, angry at me for opening it. She told me to go to my room and I’m trying to remember what the note had said, definitely said prescription and had my doctors signature. Months have passed, and I’ve heard nothing from my mom about it. When I ask she denies that I ever got my test results. I know she’s very hesitant about medication and she has denied me getting anti depressants when I was prescribed them in the past. I want to know if she is keeping me from getting medication, is it illegal, and what can I do?"

"Neighbor doesn't like my trees (NJ)     I moved into my house 4 years ago, and my next door neighbor has always complained to me about the leaves that fall from my trees onto his property. There are 10 trees that line our property line that are on my property. He is an elderly gentleman that is out there every day in the fall raking the leaves. Every time I see him he complains about all the leaves. My response was always, sorry not cutting them down.   This spring after a rainy night with high winds, I got a knock on my door from the police. They were just letting me know that my neighbor is stating that a branch fell from my tree and cracked the windshield of his car. Mind you his car is parked 30 feet from these trees. I couldn’t even find any evidence of a broken tree branch amongst my trees.  This week I received a certified letter from him stating that all 10 trees are rotten. (No evidence of rot on any of the trees) and  he has 4 years worth of damages to his cars, house, gutters, rose bushes and volumes of leaves every fall and winter. With pictures of all the damages. Again, his house is 50 feet from the property line.  He is asking me for removal of the trees plus reimbursement of cost and damages to his property and vehicles or he will be referring to an attorney.  How should I proceed? Should I send pictures of all 10 trees showing no rot? Am I responsible for any of these damages?"

"refine this text for a scientific paper: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery has become essential to monitor and manage natural resources at scale due to its global coverage, recurrence of acquisition and spatial resolution. However, satellite data is heavily affected by weather phenomena such as the presence of clouds, haze, and snow, which limits its applicability. This drawback is partially alleviated by the recurrence of data acquisition, that increases the probability of finding pixels free from such weather effects, hence enabling the replacement of affected areas with temporally close data. Nonetheless, applying this method at scale requires to identify affected pixels accurately and automatically. To that end, we leveraged Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and month-long Sentinel-2 time series to compose cloud-free mosaics in an automatic manner. To do so, we increased spatial resolution of all 20- and 60-meters bands of each Sentinel-2 scene in a time series to 10 meters by applying the super-resolution CNN model DSen2. The semantic segmentation CNN model HRNet was then applied on super-resolved scenes to detect pixels covered by haze, snow, and clouds, as well as their shadows, generating binary invalid pixels masks. These masks were then used to calculate pixel-wise weights of each scene in the time series according to proximity to invalid pixels and the difference between scene’s acquisition date and the central date of the month. Once weights are computed, a pixel-wise weighted average of all scenes in a time series is computed for all 12 bands, resulting in a 10m resolution cloud-free Sentinel-2 mosaic. Results show that this methodology can reliably compose cloud-free mosaics given enough scenes in the time series, while preserving pixel information of temporally close scenes and avoiding artifacts that could hamper the applicability of this method."

"In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
One example is below.

"Teacher: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will be affected as mentioned in the Tail or not. These effects are social actions that may occur after the Head event. For example, X may get hugged, and Y may blush in response. Classify your answers into ""Yes"" and ""No"". The phrase may also contain ""___"", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
Head: PersonX goes the way of the dodo<sep>Tail: none
Solution: Yes

"[star wars] How was the Empire able to control an entire galaxy with such few ships? In Return of the Jedi we see the largest Empire force. But it didn’t look big enough to command millions of planets. And the Rebellion would be just a gnat to it. yes i realize the empire had more capital ships and forces in other areas of the galaxy.  but a galaxy has billions of stars and at least millions of worlds.    if the empire fleet from return of the jedi was the largest concentration of their forces, how could they possibly have an iron grip on millions of star systems?  and the rebellion fleet, if the empire DID in fact have massive forces that weren’t at the Endor battle; the rebellion was basically a gnat to the empire.    it seems unlikely that the rebellion had massive forces in reserve.    if that’s true then it follows that the rebellion was minuscule compared to the empire.  just an annoying fly.    unless of course, back to my first point: the empire’s total fleet force was way too small to control an entire galaxy"
"[General Anime] What the heck is up with everyone announcing their moves before they do them: “Activate Form 13!,” “Blast Attack!,” “Whirlwind Blades!,” why can’t they just do the attack?

I’ve watched a good 10-20 different anime shows or movies with him and they constantly (not every show obviously) have to have a showy move and announce each move every time.  I’ve even seen this in a Transformers anime where the Transformers would literally say something to effect of “Arm cannon fire!” or “Blaster bolt!”   Seems stylistic but...why?  It’s so unrealistic that my suspension of disbelief is broken.

"CMV Bernie's wealth tax on net worth is well-meaning, but terrible idea. Disclaimer:  While I won't vote for Bernie, I fully recognize that he's well meaning  and he has my respect. I'm not against the idea of wealth tax, but my issue is more about how he's implementing it.  Few weeks ago Bernie proposed wealth tax, for the details,  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/24/20880941/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax-warren-2020  Problem is those most of of ultra rich's net worth comes from ownership/share in companies.  They will be forced to sell shares just to pay tax. This will seriously disrupt the stock market/economy.  One  may argue that they could use dividend to pay the tax, but there's no  fixed rate for dividend and it varies from company to company.  What  about startup founders? They put incredible amount of work and  sacrifice and a lot of times they retain share to maintain the control."

It requiring an intense amount of concentration and effort to distinguish his own body from that of the other's. Equally matched, at least in their inexperience, neither gained ascendancy. Snar's one advantage lay in growing up as the offspring of a high-ranking officer, an inheritance that now stood him in good stead.

While he maintained the mental struggle, Snar leaped the gap between them and in two snips removed two of his foe's adjacent limbs. Any three legs were sufficient for walking, but not for battle. Snar's opponent retained the sense of mind to drop to the ground since his claws could still articulate for full defensive coverage, but the psychic shock of his sudden reversal of fortune heralded his end.

Snar completely shredded the other's will and sense of self. Exultant in the hormonal afterglow of such strenuous and overwhelming effort, Snar leisurely spent a period of time experimenting as he remotely manipulated and explored the absolute extent of his power over his new thrall. This amusement soon palled, so he sent a death pulse and the remaining legs sagged against the lifeless shell.

Snar scratched through the frozen surface to find a seep hole of the chemical slurry his kind used for nutrition. He knelt so that the semi-permeable membrane that surrounded his leg joints submerged enough for osmosis. He was extremely hungry from the stress of battle, as well as the recent molt. He stood up and hesitated, then returned to his defeated adversary and grabbed one of the dismembered limbs.

He placed it in the slurry, where, in time, it would generate a small Nuplar identical to the original. He could have regenerated clones from all five joints, but did not think such a quick defeat deserved propagation. He only saved the one because this was a cousin of his bloodline. The grandparent would retrieve the new child at the end of the games, locating it by the resonating signature since the donor had regenerated from one of his own legs in some previous battle.

Full of confidence, Snar sought a bolder strategic position.

To generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 in R, you can use the sample() function. Here's the algorithm to generate the random integers and store them in a vector:
1. Declare a vector variable to store the random integers.
2. Generate the random integers using the sample() function.
3. Store the generated random integers in the vector.
4. Display the vector to verify that the integers are stored correctly.
Here's the R code to implement the above algorithm:
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducibility
rand_int <- sample(1:1000, 100, replace = TRUE) # generate 100 random integers between 1 and 1000 and store in a vector
print(rand_int) # display the vector of random integers
Can you explain how the set.seed() function works in R and why it's used in this code?"
"Am I too old to be pursuing a career in Academia? Tl;'dr at bottom  I'm a 33-year-old man. Will hiring bodies pass me up and choose someone else if they are younger? Assuming we are matched in most other ways?  Its my childhood dream, and lifelong dream, to get involved with archaeological research. I know Im not gonna be making a lot. That doesn't matter to me at all. I just want to be apart of the discovery and help contribute to science and the human story.  I did not go to college after high school. Circumstances lead me in another direction. I went through some difficult things and began working in construction. I didn't get another opportunity to go back to school until I was 27 years old.  I loved getting back into school and did quite well and got involved in a number of school related activities, wrote for the paper and tutored college English to ESL students.  I too another break after reaching my  degree. an AA-T; Associates in Arts to Transfer. and then applied to a state college. I put off going back because of covid. I much prefer being in class in person as Im sure many others do too.  I was accepted at the school and am in a Bachelors program with a major in anthropology. I think getting a BA in general anthropology is a good idea because it opens up a few more doors than just archaeology alone. And I think anthro. is easier to sell to a future employer and is good on a resume. I intend to get a masters and if I can find work in the field in the meantime that would be a double win.  I would love to go beyond a masters and a definitely want to get involved in research and academic archaeology that involves work over seas.  Tl;dr  So here I am. I just turned 33.  I have solid reasons why I'm so far behind but I still feel awful and feel upset about it but I am not giving up.  Even if you dont have any knowledge of archaeology I would still very much like to hear from you.  I am the only person I'm my extended family to get this far in school. I dont have friends or siblings whom I can as for advice"

"[NY] coworker keeps coming to work sick I work closely with this woman at work that keeps coming to work sick. In the last two months she has had RSV, COVID, and now the flu. She comes to the office everyday ill and leave partway through the day (except Covid when she was ordered to stay home, but she came in days before very sick but testing negative).  I have health struggles and had a surgery recently. I had to test negative for Covid or the surgery would have been rescheduled until next year. Luckily, I asked to work from home to avoid that.   I can not keep getting sick with my health issues. I also am pissed she keeps doing this. We have others that are struggling with health issues and can not afford to get sick either. What can I do? I want to talk to the owner. And it’s so damn stupid of her because we can work from home. Why can’t she just stay at home instead of bringing this crap in the office?"
"You are given a paragraph, with numbered sentences, and a question. Write the numbers of the sentences needed to answer the given question. Separate multiple sentence numbers with a comma ("", ""). E.g. ""1, 2"" would be the correct response if Sent 1 and Sent 2 are needed to answer the given question (do not include sentences that contain no information that is necessary to answer the question). Sort the sentence numbers in an increasing order (i.e., '1, 2', instead of '2, 1'). Your answer should not contain anything than the sentence numbers separated by a comma (e.g. '1, 2, 3, 4'). The given question requires more than one sentence to answer. So, your answer must contain at least one comma ("", "").

Q: Paragraph- Sent 1: A Republican bid to keep the government open past Friday includes no new money for the construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to several congressional aides familiar with ongoing talks.
Sent 2: GOP leaders submitted the new offer Tuesday afternoon in an effort to appease Democrats, whose votes are needed to avert a shutdown of federal agencies, several House and Senate aides said.
Sent 3: However, Republicans also insisted on increases in border security and defense spending, including money to repair existing fencing and new surveillance technology to patrol the nearly 2,000-mile border.
Sent 4: Democrats have indicated that they would support such appropriations so long as no money goes toward an actual wall.
Question: Who has to be appeased to keep the government open?.
A: 1, 2.
Rationale: The question is: Who has to be appeased to keep the government open? The phrase ""appease Democrats"" is mentioned in Sent 2, about accepting offer that is mentioned in Sent 1 to ""keep the government open"". So, Sent 1 and Sent 2 are the sentences needed to answer this question.

"Teacher: In this task, you are given an input list A. You need to convert all the alphabets in the list with a number representing their position in the English alphabet. E.g., replace A by 1, B by 2, a by 1, b by 2, and so on.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
['8129', 'a', '4245', '2391', 'Y', '7569']
Solution: 8129, 1, 4245, 2391, 25, 7569
Reason: Here, the alphabets in the list are 'a' and 'Y', hence we replace them by their positions in the English alphabet '1' and '25', respectively in the input list to get '8129, 1, 4245, 2391, 25, 7569'.

Now, solve this instance: ['829', '6713', '5923', 'P', 'J', '2909', 'X', '3409', '8797', '6919', '5213', 'z', '8843', 'D', 'R', 'o']

"How can I make cookie dough that won't bake when heated? I know this sounds like a weird question - hear me out!   I recently made this cookie dough cake. I really love the idea of a cookie dough cake and I thought that the icing and cookie dough bits were *on point*. However, the sponge of the cake is really dense and flavorless. I kind of felt like the sponge was just a vehicle for the cookie dough instead of the primary focus of the cake.   I'd like to use a different sponge recipe (brown butter/brown sugar based) to get a lighter sponge... But I don't think it would hold up with the GIANT chunks of cookie dough that the recipe calls for.   Instead, I'd like to see if there's a way to make small ""balls"" of cookie dough and mix them into the batter like chocolate chips. I'm thinking the size of the chunks of cookie dough you'd find in cookie dough ice cream. However, because they are so small I'm worried that they will melt or bake into the batter while the cake is baking.   Any ideas on how I might accomplish this?"
"Got robbed at Walmart by someone who I think is my coworker but management says it isn't and implied my job is in jeopardy Posted this on /r/walmart and was suggested to put it here as well.    Tried posting as a throwaway but guess it was too new, and wouldn't show up. This is a side account I randomly created years ago.  I am an autistic special needs janitor at a wal mart in PA.    The other day as I was going to my car (I was off) just buying some food. A coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. He starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. He said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.  At this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. Now I am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. He is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. I would of been no match if he tried anything.  In the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. He called the number I gave to make sure it was the correct number. Thus me at this point acquiring his number.  The next day before work I receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. I go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number I gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.  When I got to work I file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate ASAP!  Fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. He responded to all the cops questions as the name I gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. The investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause I handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. I have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.  Management talked to me today and an assistant who is not AP said he did the investigation and determined it was not who I said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who I accused. Who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. They wont show me the footage. Also they casually decided to inform me I got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.  Now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person I said it was  Heads up this situation has gotten out to the rest of the store (Not surprising)  Any advice on this situation?"

"Medication excuse to avoid drinking? I’m a female in my 20’s and I am trying to avoid drinking for a while, I’m in college so every social event includes alcohol, and I’ve always been a drinker in social situations.

I’ve found metronidazole to be something with the effects I’m looking for although I don’t want to be perceived with that condition. There’s also some blood clot medication I read about having severe negative effects with alcohol, but i don’t think it’s realistic in my case considering I’m pretty healthy and I don’t think people would believe it, as well as anti depressants but they know I’m the complete opposite of depressed and I don’t need the concern. Please recommend some prescription medication that has extreme adverse effects when mixed with alcohol that could apply to me. THANK YOU!   Also, telling them i don’t want to, won’t help, since they know I like to drink, so please just recommend medications so I can avoid the peer pressure and annoyance of my friends!"

"What are the types of salad dressing? First, sorry for this stupid questions. I live in Asia and foods here dont usually include salad dressing as their ingredients or sauces. So yea, im pretty confused about the type of salad dressing because there so many types. So last week, i went to some western restaurant and only order foods with salad dressing.  Ceasar salad = the dressing is a bit salty but there are two types, one is white colour, one is orange-ish colour.  Burger = the dressing looks kinda between green and yellow, seems like they added some pickles and chopped onions, it tastes sour.  The salad from kfc = taste sweet, im not sure whats the ingredients but it has carrot, raisin and lettuce?  I bought a mayonaise myself. At first i thought this is the same white dressing as the ceasar salad i wrote above but its sour, the white dressing from ceasar salad is salty.  So yea im pretty confused about the taste, is all salad tastes salty and they just add something to change the taste and colour of the dressing?  Also, i saw thousand island dressing in the store, what does it taste like? Sour, sweet or salty?"

"CMV: Resisting arrest should not be allowed as the solo criminal charge In March of this year, police officers in Sacramento arrested a man they misidentified as having a warrant out for his arrest. The arrest turned physical with an officer kicking the suspect while he was being compliant. Even though he was later confirmed to not have a warrant, the police charged him with a single count of resisting arrest.   Just earlier today, a disturbing video was made public that showed an officer from the Anderson Police using a recently banned ""chokehold restraint"" to arrest a man that was only eventually charged with resisting arrest.   Using this as a sole charge is often the byproduct of a police mistake or even an unjustified arrest. I believe that the charge is meant to deflect from police misconduct and place the blame on the defendant. It does not serve the interest of justice to use ""resisting arrest"" as a sole charge, especially if the arrest was a case of mistaken identity."

"Text= ...If I call the Wehrmacht, if I now demand the German people to sacrifice,
and if necessary, I demand to sacrifice everything, I have the right to do so.
Because I am ready today, as I did in the past, to bring any personal sacrifice,
I do not demand of any German man to do anything I was not prepared to do
myself for four years. There should be no deprivation in Germany that I will
not share. My entire life belongs from this moment on to my people. I want
nothing else now than to be the first soldier of the German Reich.

 I have now put on the same uniform that was once my dearest and holiest. I
will only take it off after the victory, or else I will not live to see that end.
Should something happen to me in this battle, my first successor will be party
member Goering. Should something happen to party member Goering, the
next in line will be party member Hess. You would then be bound by blind
loyalty to them as Fuehrers , as you were to me. Should something happen to
party member Hess, I will enact a law that the senate will then elect the
worthiest, i.e. the bravest from their midst.

 As National Socialist and as a German soldier I am going into this battle with
a brave heart. My whole life was nothing but one continuous battle for my
people, for its renewal, for Germany. This battle was always backed by the
faith in this people. There is one word I have never known. It is surrender. If
anybody thinks we may be heading towards difficult times, I want to ask him to
remember that once a Prussian king with a minuscule state faced a big
coalition and won after three battles, because he had a strong heart and faith.
This is what we need today. And I want to tell the whole world: never again
will there be a November 1918 in German history! Just as I am ready to
sacrifice my life at any moment for my people and Germany, I demand the
same from everyone. Anyone who believes he can evade this national
command – whether directly or indirectly – will fall. Traitors can only expect
death.

 In this we all follow an old principle: It is of no consequence if we live, but it is
essential that our nation will live, that Germany lives....

"Read this for context:
Roxana is a shareholder because Roxana wants to have a say in the company's direction. As a shareholder, Roxana is able to vote on corporate decisions and elect the board of directors. Having a say in the company's direction ensures that Roxana's interests are represented at the highest level of decision-making.

Roxana: Hey, thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I know we're both busy, but I wanted to talk to you about something important.
CEO: Of course, what's on your mind?
Roxana: I'm a shareholder in the company, and I'm concerned about the direction it's going in. Specifically, I'm worried about the level of risk the company is taking on.
CEO: Understandable. Can you give me some examples of what you're referring to?
Roxana: Well, for starters, I noticed that we've been investing a lot in new product development recently. And while I think it's important to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, I worry that we might be biting off more than we can chew financially. We could end up overstretched and end up losing money instead of making it.
CEO: Hmm...I see your point. But let me ask you this - why do you think shareholders should be worried about this? After all, isn't it our job as management to make decisions that are in the best interests of the company? And if we believe that investing in new products is the best way to grow the business and generate returns for shareholders, then isn't that what we should do?
Roxana: Well...I guess my concern is that shareholders could end up footing the bill if things go wrong with these new products. For example, if we invest a lot of money into developing a new product and it ends up being a flop, shareholders could lose a lot of money. And even if the product is successful but only marginally so, shareholders may not see much return on their investment either. So there's definitely potential downside here from a shareholder perspective.
CEO: Yes, I see your point. But at the same time, there's also potential upside - if these new products are successful, they could generate significant returns for shareholders. So it really comes down to weighing the risks and rewards before making any decisions.""

"You are given a target profession, and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them.

Let me give you an example: Target: musician 
Mark's child became a musician after school. I painted my walls blue but I'm considering adding some appliques to increase interest.
The answer to this example can be: unrelated
Here is why: This is unrelated because the second sentence has no relevance with the first one.

"Given a text passage as input consisting of dialogues of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, the task is to classify the text into one of the labels from the two possible outputs - 'accepted'/'rejected'. Select [accepted] if by the end of the conversation the buyer seems likely to buy the item from the seller. A sale is likely made when the buyer and seller agree upon a common price or when a deal is made between them. Select [rejected] if the buyer did not seem interested in buying the item from the seller at the end of the conversation.

"Ethics of Leaving a Job Very Early-On I am an electrical engineer that just recently graduated with my BS with a focus in industrial controls and automation. I took a position with a fairly large consulting company before the pandemic began back in December. My start date was then pushed from May to August because of the virus and a lack of work. However now that I have started I am becoming increasingly frustrated as I am being given very little guidance, receiving little to no communication (currently working from home), and very little meaningful work. I am becoming increasingly unsure about wether or not a company that treats a new hire in this way, even during this pandemic, is one that I want to be working for.   While sitting at my desk with literally nothing to do I began browsing LinkedIn and came across a very intriguing job opening from another company with whom I had a chance to work with on a project during a Co-op in school. I really want to apply but am worried that jumping ship at my current company is not ethical since I have only been there about a month. Has anyone been in a similar situation or how should I approach this situation?"

Even if the laptop I am seeing right now did not actually exist, it is nonetheless true that it seems to me, phenomenally, that there is a laptop in front of me. Even if solipsism were true, I myself would have qualia; it is just that no one else would.  But, if I am right, there are theories of mind such as behaviourism and eliminative materialism which deny the existence of qualia altogether. I do not understand how anyone could sensibly deny the existence of qualia."

"In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_). The sentence pair should look similar and should be about two different persons (PersonX and PersonY). Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., ""sympathetic"" and ""stern"") which express contrasting attributes about the two persons. The answer to the first and the second sentence must be PersonX and PersonY, respectively. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people (e.g., Donald Trump, Putin, etc.) in your sentences. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.
Example: Context word: upset.
Example solution: Sentence 1: PersonX yelled at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news. 
Sentence 2: PersonX comforted at PersonY because _ was so upset about the news.
Example explanation: As expected, two sentences contain mentions of PersonX and PersonY and they're quite similar. Their difference is in terms of trigger words (""yelled"" and ""comforted""), whcih result in them having different answers. As required by the instructions, the answer to sentence 1 and sentence 2 are PersonX and PersonY, respectively.

"CMV: The “Don’t Say Gay” bill does not discriminate against the LGBT community First, the bill is called “Florida House Bill 1557: Parental Rights in Education”. From my understanding, the part that is the most controversial is the fact that it prohibits the discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classroom settings from kindergarten to third grade.   I think this is exactly as it should be. Kids are only 5-8 in these grades. This bill doesn’t limit sexual education in any way as it allows for the typical sex ed classes in middle/high school.   Even if you think discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity should take place prior to middle school, this bill also limits the discussion of heterosexuality and cis gender identity, so this doesn’t harm LGBT people any more than it does straight people."

"For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"Why do engineering companies hire contractors? Specifically in the defense field, and I don't mean temporary contractors. I mean the engineers who are pretty much a full time employee, but wear a different badge, and they stay there for the entire length of the contract.  I even used to be a contractor, and we pretty much had guaranteed employment as long as we didn't seriously mess up. We even got better pay and benefits than the people we worked for. So why do engineering companies hire contractors instead of just making them their own employees?"

Lynzee: Yeah, actually there is someone. Her name is Sarah and she's amazing. We've been dating for a while now and I can't imagine my life without her.
Cherelle: That's great! It sounds like you're really in love with her. Marriage is a huge commitment though, so you need to make sure that you're absolutely sure before taking that step. Are you sure that she feels the same way about you?
Lynzee: Yeah, I am pretty confident that she does feel the same way about me since she has hinted at marriage before too. Plus, we just generally have a great time together and get along really well so I think that bodes well for our future together.

Not as much resistance, and it felt very weird on my skin. Almost as if there was no friction against my skin.  What's the cause of this? Is it surface tension? Maybe a weird chemical reaction with my skin that makes it feel that way?  I googled this and only got results about treating open wounds with alcohol."

"As part of the course you’ll take on 3 modules – Human Structure and Function (HSF), World of Microorganisms (WOM) and Molecular Basis of Life (MBL).
WOM and MBL are part of the School of Biological Sciences – in these modules you’ll be seated alongside Biologists, Zoologists, Medicinal Chemists and many others. These are also the bigger modules with 300 in each!
These modules have lectures on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In addition to this you’ll also sit a 3 hour lab once a week.
HSF happens on Tuesday and Thursday (so yes… you’ll be in everyday of the week). The class is a lot smaller – 115 people. The content here is pretty varied and you’ll have a mixture of lectures, practicals (anatomy and physiology) and tutorials.
As a whole the lecturers are very accessible. You can easily contact them by their email – either to get an answer to your question or arrange to meet with them if you’re have particular difficulty with something. You can just as easily approach them at the end of the lecture.
You are expected to work outside the lecture hours but how much or how little you do is up to you. They give you estimates for how long you should spend (we were told at the start we should expect 9-5 days) but work it into a schedule that suits you. I know from experience that going over a lecture can take me from 1 to 3 hours!
Almost all lecturers will also provide you with additional reading to go alongside the lecture – it’s great for learning more about a topic… especially if it’s an area you are specifically interested in.
All practicals are timetabled and are carried out in one of Queen's many labs. You’ll learn many techniques that are used in professional laboratories. They also give you the opportunity to visualise what you have been learning in lectures.
Tutorials are part of the HSF module. They provide an opportunity to apply what you have been learning in lectures to real life situations. I definitely find them challenging as sometimes the answer isn’t always clear so they’re a great opportunity to ask questions too.
They’re also great for interacting with the lecturer who’ll be able to guide the direction of your thoughts to help you answer the question.
Throughout the year you will sit a number of assessments across all three modules. The marks from the assessments are included in your final module mark. Assessments can take very different forms – computer multiple choice, written or group work!
In the case of WOM and MBL weekly labs also make up part of your final mark. At the end of the year you each module requires you to sit a written exam.
Once you’ve got through all this you’re more than ready for the weekend to come!

The funeral for one of the victims of a car crash near Calne, described as a ""ray of sunshine"" by his family, will be held this week.

The crash on the A4 in Derry Hill at around 3am on August 16, in which a car crashed into a house and caught fire, resulted in the deaths of Ryan Nelson, 20, Corey Owen, 19, Matthew Parke, 19, and Jordan Rawlings, 20.

The funeral of Ryan Nelson will be held on Friday afternoon (September 18), with the cortege to drive through the Wiltshire town to allow mourners to pay their respects.

Family tributes to Ryan described him as a ""ray of sunshine"" who was ""loved by everyone"".

The moving tribute said: ""Ryan, our ray of sunshine. He lightened up everyone's life, a truly wonderful gentleman, so polite with lovely morals.

""Ryan worked in Tesco. He loved it there as he was with his friends. He was a massive football fan. He supported Aldershot Town FC and Manchester United. He was a very talented DJ, it was something he wished to pursue in the future.

""Ryan was loved by everyone. He has the most beautiful soul. So handsome, he loved all his designer gear, had so much pride. Our lives are empty without him.""

Floral tributes to all four victims were left by the side of the A4 in the aftermath of the crash as the local community honoured them.

The funeral procession will pass by Calne Town Hall at 2pm and will then proceed towards the Tesco store where Ryan worked.

There will be a celebration of Ryan's life after the service, but this is by invitation only to ensure it can be held safely at a Covid-secure venue.

The details of funerals of the other victims have not been disclosed at this time.

Anyone wanting to pay respects to the victims has been warned by police that they need to do so in line with social distancing rules and the newly-introduced 'rule of six' when lining the streets.

Inspector James Brain, from the Chippenham Area Community Policing Team, said the police and the local authority had been working closely with the family to allow them to celebrate Ryan's life in as safe a way as possible.

He said: ""We completely understand that those who knew and loved Ryan want to be able to come together to remember him and pay their last respects.

""However, his family have made it clear that they want to be able to do this in a safe way, which does not pose a risk to public health.

""The town will see four funerals over the coming weeks, and I know this period of mourning will be very difficult for those having to say goodbye to much-loved sons, brothers and friends.

Wiltshire Council has also reminded mourners of the need to pay their respects safely, while recognising this was a ""devastating time"" for all involved.

Terence Herbert, chief executive of Wiltshire Council, said: ""This is a devastating time for those involved and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the four young men who lost their lives in this tragic accident.

""Understandably the family and friends of Corey, Jordan, Matthew, and Ryan want to celebrate their lives. We are working closely with colleagues at the police to support them to do so safely and within the latest Government legislation.

""These are unprecedented times and we understand this is difficult for those grieving loved ones.""
