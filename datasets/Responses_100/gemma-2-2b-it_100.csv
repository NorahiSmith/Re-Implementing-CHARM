Magnetotactic bacteria from Pavilion Lake, British Columbia
Introduction
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) have been found in a variety of aquatic sediments such as marine environments, freshwater lakes and rivers, hot springs, and brackish waters all over the world . In these settings, MTB tend to reside in chemically stratified water or sediment at the oxic-anoxic interface. The common feature that is unique to all MTB is their ability to synthesize intracellular membrane-bound crystals of single domain magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4) . The magnetosomes provide a torque on the cells that passively aligns them with the Earth's geomagnetic field. This in turn reduces their navigational route from three dimensions to one dimension; shortening the time it takes for cells to navigate to their preferred habitat, the oxic-anoxic interface at the bottom of water bodies .

Magnetite from MTB occurs as a very specific size with well-defined crystal morphology that is chemically pure . Such minerals are preserved in the rock record as “magnetofossils,” which have been found in Mesozoic rocks, and may extend back as far as the pre-Cambrian . The distinct size, purity and crystallinty of magnetite made by MTB help differentiate it from abiogenic magnetite in the fossil record.

This study investigates uncultured MTB from Pavilion Lake, a deep, slightly alkaline, freshwater lake in British Columbia. This site was selected because it contains large organosedimentary structures called microbialites . Such structures abound in the fossil record back to nearly 3.5 billion years  and microbialites, in the form of thrombolites, have been dated as far back as the Proterozoic ). The MTB that we isolated from Pavilion Lake belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria class. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of the cells, and the size and shape of magnetosomes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the chemical composition of the magnetosomes. This is the first time MTB have been described from a microbialite-forming environment. This discovery could be of great value to others interested in potential life forms on other planets or the earliest forms of life on Earth as Pavilion Lake contains microbial fossils in the freshwater microbialites.

Soccer-Liverpool's Jordan Henderson named England's Footballer of the Year

Liverpool's Premier League title winning captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers' Association (FWA).

(Adds details)

By Simon Evans

July 24 (Reuters) - Liverpool's Premier League title winning
captain Jordan Henderson was named England's Footballer of the
Year on Friday in the annual vote of the Football Writers'
Association (FWA).

Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Manchester United's
Marcus Rashford and Liverpool pair Virgil van Dijk and Sadio
Mane made up the rest of the top five.

The 30-year-old Henderson has been central to Liverpool's
success under Juergen Klopp through his leadership and tireless
midfield work.

""As grateful as I am I don't feel like I can accept this on
my own. I don't feel like anything I've achieved this season or
in fact during my whole career has been done on my own,"" said
Henderson.

""I owe a lot to so many different people – but none more so
than my current team mates – who have just been incredible and
deserve this every bit as much as I do,"" he said.

Henderson has played in 30 of Liverpool's league matches so
far this season and scored four goals.

Two other Liverpool players - right back Trent
Alexander-Arnold and goalkeeper Alisson Becker - also received
votes.

""I accept it on behalf of this whole squad, because without
them I'm not in a position to be receiving this honour. These
lads have made me a better player – a better leader and a better
person,"" added Henderson.

""If anything I hope those who voted for me did so partly to
recognise the entire team's contribution.""

The Footballer of the Year trophy has been awarded since
1948 when Stanley Matthews was its first recipient.

"CMV: Sanders and Warren will beat Biden if (and only if) one drops out and runs as the other's vp NOW Assuming that Sanders and Warren are both ideology-driven candidates, running for the primary purpose of furthering their (mostly overlapping) agenda, they should form a running coalition in which one drops out to run as the other's running mate, thus giving them a fighting chance at one of them getting the nomination.  The number of progressive voters isn't large enough to beat Biden if Sanders and Warren split the vote, but almost certainly is if it is coalesced.  Currently, RCP has the following poll averages:  Nationally: Biden: 32.2 Sanders: 16.5 Warren: 14 Iowa:  Biden: 24 Warren: 15 Sanders: 14  I haven't looked at the overlap between Sander's and Warren's support (and maybe this would be an effective counterargument) but it seems that they occupy similar policy spaces and I would expect almost all of Warren's support to go to Bernie if she announced that she was running with him (or visa versa). It would almost tie them with Biden immediately, which we would expect given that roughly half of democratic voters identify as liberal and half moderate.  Furthermore, bringing one of the two candidates into the spotlight would allow progressive voters, volunteers, donors, media AND support organizations to focus their attention and resources on one of them. It would also activate and engage disenfranchised progressive constituents who are feeling discouraged about the current chances of either progressive candidate winning the race.  NOTE: I only intend to argue this from a strategic perspective.

This argument rests on several key assumptions:

* **Shared Ideology:** The argument assumes Sanders and Warren are ideologically aligned, which, while likely true, is not guaranteed. Their policy positions can overlap but also diverge. 
* **Coalesced Progressive Vote:** It assumes a significant portion of progressive voters would coalesce behind one candidate if the other dropped out. This is a crucial assumption, as split support might dilute the overall progressive vote.

"[Meta] Signing off as a mod Normally mods come and go without much fanfair, but I thought I'd take a moment to explain why I'm leaving as a mod and most likely the sub.  I've been part of this community for about 7 years now and watched it grow bigger. There have been some changes - some popular and some less so. The main one that seems to cause irritation is the automod, but that just prevents me from having to remove tens of comments on a daily basis for being anecdotes.   This is also an issue we get a lot of abuse over. Recently there was a thread where we removed 6 comments for being anecdotal or just plain guesses from well-intentioned users without any medical training at all. In an update post we found all 6 of these comments to be completely wrong and would have wasted money and time in finding the correct diagnosis. So yes, there is harm in these guesses and we remove them. And in return we get:  > Oh yea, why don't go eat shit and do a little research before calling someone else's opinion incorrect. And then go fuck yourself. Retard. Now go ahead and ban me because you are wrong like homeless bum.  Or   >I'm sorry but didnt it not address the concern? Your rules fucking Suck jam it up your ass. Go ahead and ban me I'm leaving anyway. Power tripping jaggoffs.  This is something I do in my spare time. I don't get paid. I do it to try to help, but people do not understand that we simply cannot diagnose things or tell them how to treat them online without seeing the animal, no matter how much we are called money grabbing assholes. The posts saying ""PLEASE HELP MY DOG IS DYING"" really aren't going to get resolved without a trip to the vet. If my dog showed the same signs I'd take him to the clinic to work him up. There are also plenty of posts where we offer advice without guessing at a diagnosis so I'm not going to bother addressing that ""what's the point of the sub"". You can argue that amongst yourselves.  I guess the TL:DR is that I'm fed up of the abuse for absolutely no reason, so now there is one less person here to offer advice. Just remember there is someone at the other end of the internet before you tell them to go fuck themselves, especially if they are a professional trying to help.

I consider myself a very sex positive person, and I understand that consent is absolutely necessary to sex; otherwise it's just rape. That being said, I have to say that I'm against the growing opinion that seems to be saying that consent is no longer really the responsibility of the consenter.  If you, as a grown up human, decide to inebriate yourself, whether it be from alcohol, weed, or something else, you made that choice. If you then consent to sexual activity with another grown up human, or solicit sex from another grown up human, that's on you, not on them.

"CMV: Democrat Leaders Extending the Patriot Act Shows Their Animosity Towards Trump is Mostly Rhetoric Of course, most people are aware of the impeachment hearings against Trump. However, just yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to fund and extend the Patriot Act for an extended 3 months after December 20th.   It seems to me hypocritical to believe that Trump is unfit for office and abused his power and then proceeds to potentially give him more power--or at least extending the duration of his current powers.   Additionally, Representative Justin Amash attempted to amend the budget bill by removing the Patriot Act language but the amendment was blocked by the Democrats on the Rules Committee. Only 10 Democrats voted against the resolution, including AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Tlaib.   The Trump administration still retains authority to reinitiate the NSA call records program, the program where millions of innocent American calls had been collected, if they deem it necessary.   Given the fact that the Trump administration could potentially extend another 4 years, it seems questionable at best why Democrats would not strip him of some of the powers he could abuse when they had the opportunity to.
